### 1.0 INTRODUCTION

Botanical name **_:_** _Allium cepa_

Onion belongs to the family, Alliaceae.I t is an annual. The bulbs are round in shape and consist
of thickened bases of leaves attached to a small conical stem. The bulbs vary from flat to round
in shape. The leaves are long, long, cylindical and hollow, often bluish in colour. The flowers
are small in terminal umbel and corolla colour is often greenish white.
It is grown by smallholder farmers in more than 100 tropical and subtropical countries. Onion
is one of the widely consumed vegetables in Ghana; it adds essential vitamins and minerals to
our food daily. Onion also has anti-oxidant properties and industrial use.

Onion ( **_Allium cepa)_** originated from Central Asia, possibly Iran and Pakistan. It was first
grown in Ghana at Bugri, near Bawku and from there it spread to other parts of the Northern
and Upper regions of Ghana**.**

Select well drained soil on a gentle slope with a pH of 5.0-7.0 (slightly acidic to neutral)onion
require sunny, semi-tropic or tropical conditions and annual rainfall of between 600mm to
1,250mm. Low humidity will result in bad fruit set due to dropping of flower buds. The ideal
temperature for good growth is between 18-32ºC.

**Typical Onion Farm**

**2.0 GROWING REQUIREMENTS**


```
· Seed treatment
· Net weight
```
```
· Percentage germination
```
```
· No foreign matter e.g. weeds seeds, dead insects, stones etc.
```
```
· Percentage purity
```
```
· No pest or mechanical damage.
```
Use certified, high-yielding onion seeds from recommended Agro - Input dealers. Decision
on which variety to cultivate must be based on target market.

**Good Quality onion seeds must have the following characteristics:**

Well packaged and properly labelled**.** The Labels should provide the following information:

```
· Virus and disease resistant
· High germination percentage i.e. between 95- 100%
```
```
· Variety
· Date of packaging
```
```
· Select sites easily accessible by vehicles and other farm machines.
```
```
· Select an open site with a deep, well-drained sandy loam soil or clay loam soil.
```
```
· Choose sites with annual rainfall of between 300-600mm well distributed throughout
the year.
```
```
· Site must have a temperature range from 24-32°C.
· Avoid sandy and heavy clay soils. (Clay soils have poor drainage capacity and hence
prone to water-logging.)
```
```
· Select sites located close to a reliable source of quality water.
```
```
· Avoid sites previously cropped with plants in the same family as onion e.g. garlic,
shallots, leeks etc.
```
```
· Choose soils with a pH range of 5 – 7.0.
```
### 4.0 SEED/VARIETALSELECTION

### 3.0 SITE SELECTION

```
· Site should have gentle slope, ideally land with1- 2% inclination
```

**Determining a good nursery site:**

**5.0 LAND PREPARATION**

```
· The nursery should be located about 20 meters away from pepper, tomato and garden egg
plants to prevent transmission of diseases to the seedlings.
· The site should be well drained and free from troublesome weeds like (nut-grass and
spear grass).
```
```
· The nursery must be located close to the farm.
```
```
· Nursery must be located near a good permanent source of water.
```
```
· Bed size should be 1m wide by any convenient length.
```
**Seedbed Preparation**

**4.1 Nursery Establishment**

**Steps in preparing a proper seedbed:**

```
· Plough across the slope to a depth of 20-30cm and harrow to a fine tilth (double plough if
necessary).
```
```
· Sterilize the soil by heaping dry grass on it and spot burn to control most soil borne
diseases and pests.
```
```
· Good sanitation must be practiced at the nursery. (All trash must be burnt between each
production cycle.)
```
```
· Mix soil and manure, then water thoroughly and leave for one week before nursing.
```
```
· Incorporate well decomposed poultry manure at the rate of 20-30ton/ha at land
preparation preferably between the first and second ploughing. In the absence of poultry
```
```
· Raise the bed for about 15-20cm above the ground level to allow good drainage.
```
```
· Prepare seed bed by digging 15 cm deep and breaking up the lumps into fine tilth.
```
```
· Make sure the surface of the bed is smooth and remove all stones, roots, and weeds.
```
```
· For one hectare plot an area of 71.5 square meters may be needed for the nursery. This
area should be divided into four beds 1m×10m each. Leave an alley of 0.5m wide
between beds and at the ends of the beds to allow for easy movement within and around
beds.
```
```
· If the area has been continuously cropped spread one bucket of well-decomposed animal
manure (poultry manure or cow dung) on a bed of size 1m×10m.
```

**5.2 Nursery Management**

```
· Between 5- 8 days count all seeds that germinate for cayenne and 8 -12 days for scotch
bonnet and cherry pepper seeds,
```
```
· Sow fifty (50) onion seeds in a germination tray or a small nursery bed
```
```
· Late germinators are weak seeds, reject them.
```
Alternatively conduct a floating test to isolate good seeds from bad seeds.

```
· Place the tray in a warm area and keep it moist.
```
```
· Pour seeds into a basin half-full of water
· Discard seeds that float on the surface of water. They are considered bad seed .Seeds that

**5.1 Germination test**

```
· Determine the viability rate (germination percentage) by dividing the number of seeds
that germinated by number of seeds sown (50) and multiply by 100.
```
```
manure, apply cow dung or other animal droppings at a rate of 30-40ton/ha. This should
be ploughed in 4-5weeks before planting (NB: spot or row application can also be done).
```
```
· Do it in triplicate and take the average.
· The germination percentage is good if test results show 85% and above.
```
```
remains under water are considered good seed and can be nursed.
```
```
· In low lying areas plant onion on ridges. Create ridges of 100 cm width and 15 cm height.
Distant between ridges should be 60 cm apart.
```
```
· Raise seedlings in the nursery to ensure maximum seed germination and quality planting
materials.
```
```
· It is highly recommended to raise all seedlings under protected structures such as net
houses or tunnels (inset image of a tunnel to illustrate what a nursery tunnel is)before
they reach the hardening stage.
```
```
· Soak seeds in clean water for two hours and dry before seeding to improve germination.
```
```
· For farmer saved seeds, treat with recommended seed dressing or hot water at 50 C for o
25mins in a water bath before sowing. (NB: seeds from certified sources are pre-treated).
· Raise seedlings in seed trays, boxes or on seed beds. Seedlings raised in trays normally
have a minimum 95% establishment rate in the field since they are transplanted with the
medium-root block. It is suitable under unfavourable weather conditions such as rainy
seasons and dry spells.
```

a. Transplant early in the morning, on a cloudy day or late afternoon. This is usually after 3

seedlings are established.

**Transplanting Procedure**

```
· Start transplanting 28 days after germination.
```
c. Adopt the recommended spacing depending on variety. See table below for planting

```
· The ideal seedling for transplanting should be stocky with 5-6 leaves, disease-free,

growth period

· Control weeds by hoeing before plants are one month old in the field.

**(a) Insect pest of onion
(i)Thrips** _(thripstabaci)_ – These are the most serious pest of onions. They pierce and suck the
sap which results in twisting of the leaves.

· At each weeding, earth-up around the stems to make plants strong to withstand

Weed timely to avoid drastic yield reduction as a result of weed competition.

· Repeat weeding every 3 weeks or weed when necessary.

```
· Silvery spots and patches on leaves
· Excreta of thrips visible as small black dot on leaves
```

**Prevention**

**Silvery patches on leaves Thrips damage**

```
· Intercrop onions with carrots which repel thrips
· Avoid planting onions near and existing infested fields
```
**Management**

**Monitoring**

```
· Look for silvery leaf spots and patches and excreta of thrips visible as small black dots
on the leaves
```
```
· Remove, dry and burn old material from the field as well as alternate host plants which
includes many types of weed (e.g. nutgrass, speargrass and Musa spp.)
· Raise seedlings in thrip free region so that seedlings are not carrying the pest
```
```
· Scout field regularly starting at the 4-th leaf stage, check spaces between newly
emerged leaves, stem and inner neck of the onions for signs of the pest
```
```
· Inspect seedlings when transplanting for any possible thrips infestation on leaf folds
· Use yellow sticky trap as monitoring device
```
**Control**
· Encourage predator activities to reduce thrips population e.g spiders and predatory
mites
· Spray with Cypermethrin +Dimethoate products at the rate of 60-80g/L
· Spray Lambda–Cyhalothrin based products at a rate of 35-40mls/15Lof water
**(ii) Cutworm (** **_Agrotisipsilon, A. segetum_** **):** Cutworms chew through plant stems at the base.
They primarily feed on roots and foliage of young plants and can cut off the plant from
underneath the soil. Severe damage causes the upper part of the plant to shrivel and die.


**Signs and Symptom**
· External feeding on leaves by young caterpillars results in the presence of timely
round window panes

```
· Small holes in the stem or cut stems
· Damage on the root's ranges from small and superficial to very large deep holes
```
```
· Feeding on the leaves, stalks and stems results in falling leaves

**Management
Prevention**

```
· Remove and burn all crop residues before planting
· Intercrop onion with mustard at every 15 rows of onion as a trap crop
```
```
· Practice farm sanitation. Keep nursery and field free of weeds and ratoon crops that may
act as alternate host and reservoirs to the cutworm
```
```
· Conserve natural enemies such as spiders, parasitic wasp, praying mantis, ants and
birds by minimizing the use of insecticides.Do not spray insecticides when natural
enemy numbers are high in the field.
```
**(i) Basal rot:** Fusarium basal rot is caused by _Fusariumoxysporum_ f. sp. cepae, a soil-borne
pathogen that can survive in soil for many years as chlamydospores or as a saprophyte on
crop residues. The pathogen infects the onion root and basal plate areacausing a dry rot.

**Signs and Symptoms**

```
· Spray Bt based products
```
**(b) Diseases**

```
· Curving, yellow or necrotic leaves. Necrosis begins at leaf tips and moves downward
```
**Control**

**Monitoring**

```
· Remove and destroy egg masses and caterpillars from plant and crush them
```
```
· Check daily for caterpillars at base of the plants and inside the leaves. Look for stout
bodied green to dark-brown caterpillars (5-10mm) with stripped margins at the back
```
```
· Wilting plants, infected bulbs may be brown and watery with rot spreading from stem
plate to basal leaves and stem plates may have brown discoloration.
```
```
· Flood the area to suffocate the larvae in the soil if you are growing onion in deep soils
```
```
· Start monitoring at seedling stage, look for dry wilted and discolored onion plants.
Infestations may show in small restricted areas. If moths are present, scout for presence
of larvae

**(ii) Downy mildew:** Downy mildew is characterized by pale–green, yellowish to
brownish areas of irregular size and shape (oval to cylindrical) on infected leaves or seed
stalks. It appears like tread- like powdery substance on the leaves and leaf tips which
collapses

**Signs and Symptoms**

**Management**

```
· Light green/yellow round, angular spots on leaves, particularly older leaves
```
```
· Transplant into disease free areas with adequate drainage
```
```
· White cotton-like growth develops on the underside of leaves in cool and humid
conditions
```
```

```

**Signs and Symptoms**

**Monitoring**

**Control**

**Prevention**
· Do not plant crop next to or downwind of infected fields since downey mildew spores
spread through wind
· Keep fields free from weeds, particularly those in the daisy or sunflower family as
these species are hosts of downey mildew. Removing weeds also improves aeration
(the pathogen favours wet environments)

```
· After harvest, collect plant remains and burn or bury deeply (at least 1m)
```
```
· Remove highly infected lower leaves to reduce disease spread
```
```
· Dark shriveled stems around the base and brown rotten roots
```
```
· During crop growth, remove any infected plants immediately and destroy by burning
or burying deeply
```
disease is caused by fungi.

```
· Inspect crop weekly for symptoms. The disease starts from lower mature leaves and
spreads progressively to younger leaves
```
**Management**

```
· Wilting, collapse and death of seedlings
```
· Downey mildew does not survive on dead plants/crop debris so there is no need to
burn or plough in crop remains
**(iii) :** It is a rot that occurs at soil level of the young crop (seedling stage). The
Damping Off

```
Damping Off damage on onion
```

The fungus survives on crop debris in the soil for at least a year. Spores of the fungus are
produced in the brown to purple blotches and are spread by wind and rain splash.

**Prevention**

```
· Monitor nursery daily for symptoms such as wilting, collapse and death of seedlings
```
```
· Solarize the soil of nursery beds before planting using clear plastic to sterilize. If the
problem persists, consider changing nursery sites
· Clean or disinfect tools (tillers, cutlasses and hoes) using 10% bleach solution
```
```
· Look for seedlings with dark shrivelled stems around the base and brown rotten roots
```
**Management**

```
· Avoid excessive fertilization at nursery to reduce damping off
· Treat seed with Mancozeb 800g/kg, Folpet 500g/l at 3-4g/kg
```
```
Monitoring
```
```
· Remove infected plants as soon as symptoms appear and destroy way from nursery
```
**Purple blotch**

```
· Sow seeds thinly to ensure aeration. Plant in raised beds to maintain good drainage
and avoid over watering
```
```
Control
```
The disease is favoured by high humidity and can occur as a secondary infection on plants
damaged by other pests, e.g. onion thrips.

```
· Leaf tips are commonly affected. They blacken, hang down, wither and die
```
**Signs and Symptoms**

```
· Light and rings may appear around the blotches and pin-head sized dark brown to
blackdotsmay appear within the blotches
```
```
· White lesions on leaves or stalks developing into oval brown to purplish areas

long
```

```

```
Remove infected plant parts and dispose by burning

**Control**

**Monitoring**

### 8.0 HARVESTING

**Management**

```
· If planting your own stored bulbs, ensure that they have been stored in dry aerated stores
and that any infected bulbs have been disposed off
```
Onions mature 80-105 days after transplanting. The leaves of mature bulb topple over from the
neck when leaves are still green. The leaves then gradually turn yellow and ultimately brown.
Harvest the bulb by lifting and dry them in the sun for about a week

**Prevention**

```
· More attention should be paid to older leaves as they are more commonly affected than
younger tissues
```
```
· Plant the seedlings or bulbs with proper spacing: 10x 10 cm for bulb crop. This will help
prevent the buildup of humid conditions favoured by the disease
```
```
Matured onion ready for harvesting
```

The yield is very much dependent on the climate during the growing season and very
unpredictable. Very often the yield does not exceed 0.9mt but when the weather is cool during
the night and warm during the day, higher yields can be obtained with fertilizers.

**8.2 Packaging and storage:**
Clean harvested bulb gently without removing or damaging outer protective coat. Dry the
bulbs in a warm airy place under shade until the leaves have shriveled. Cut the dry leaves
leaving about2cm to avoid entry of decay organisms. Remove immature and soft ones and store
only healthy and attractive bulbs. Store onions in a shaded and well ventilated room

**8.3 Grade and package** :

Onion yields about 15-20tons /ha depending on variety and adherence to good agricultural
practice.

**8.4 Marketing**

**8.1 Yield:**

Grade onions according to sizes and Package onion in 10, 20 and 50kg jute sacks for transport
to the market or for storage.

Onion will continue to deliver good value to the smallholder farmers involved in its
production. There are major markets where onions can be sold for income. It can also be dried
powered or processed into paste.
