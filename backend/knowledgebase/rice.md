### 1.0 INTRODUCTION

```
Botanical name: Oryza sativa
Rice is the seed of a semi-aquatic grass plant; Oryza sativa that is native to India,
Southeast Asia and China.There are two main species of rice oryza sativa which all modern
high-yielding rice varieties belong. The other variety is oryza gblaberrima which originates
from West Africa and is still grown by some peasant farmers.
Rice has become the second most important staple food for millions of people after maize in
Ghana. Its consumption keeps increasing as a result of population growth, urbanization and
change in consumer's behaviour. Apart from the grain used as food, the straw serves as source
of fuel, roofing materials and also feed for livestock or ploughed back into the soil to add
nutrients. The main production areas include: Western region, Volta region and the three
Northern regions.

Choose (containsome fertile land with deep loamy and non-acidic clay and/or organic matter, i.e. loamy soil).Low-lying soils with good water retention and valley bottoms capacity are
most preferred.Construct animal traction. Due to climate bunds around variabilitythe field to retain water and suppress , climate smart agriculture activities weeds using hoe, which include;
early planting zones. taking into consideration the planting seasons for the various agro-ecological

### 4.0 LAND PREPARATION

Land can be prepared land for cultivation conventionally in the savannah using tractor or animal and transition zones. traction A good soil tillage to plough and harrow practice the
contributes to efficient fertilizer use, increased soil porosity and aeration.

In the forest zones, upland fields are slashed and stumped. Systemic herbicides may be used to
kill regrowth and soggy. For flooded before planting. fields, slash and collect trash from field.Lowlands can be prepared as upland except when it is flooded

### 5.0 PLANTING

· Place seeds on a moist cloth, cotton or tissue paper and cover with a thin layer of soil.

**(ii)Raising seedlings (nursery management)**


```
In the Random method, seedlings are transplanted without a definite distance or space between
plants. The Straight-row method follows a uniform spacing between plants. The seedlings are
transplanted in straight rows.
```
```
In the Upland cultivation, nursed seedlings are transplanted when the seedlings are about 21
days after seeding with the recommended planting distances. The nursery bed should be
watered regularly to keep the soil moist but notpuddled. Good drainage should be provided
to ensure that nursery is not flooded
```
```
There are two methods for planting rice: Transplanting and Direct seeding
Transplanting is done in one of two methods: Randomor Straight-row.
```
```
(iii)Methods of planting
```
```
For Direct seeding, there are three techniques which are; Broadcasting, Drilling and Dibbling.
```
**NB:** The main advantage of drilling/dibbling is efficiency in seed use.

**6.0 FERTILIZER APPLICATION**

**6.1 Inorganic/chemical fertilizers**

**_Second application_** : Top dress with 50kg (one bag)/ha Sulphate of Ammonia or 75kg (1 and a
half bag of Urea)5 – 6 weeks after seedling emergence and just before booting.
**6.2 UDP (Urea Deep Placement)**

UDP technology makes nitrogen available to the crop throughout its growth cycle. Plants are
able to absorb production costs for farmers. more of the applied It performs nutrients, best in clay and silt soils and in rice production resulting in higher crop yields and lower

Apply organic manure as follows;
· Spread 7 to 8 tons (140 – 160 bags)/ha of cow dung or 4 tons (80 bags) decomposed
poultry manure/ha and work into the soil before planting under rain-fed conditions.
· Spread manure/ha 7 to 8 tons (140 – 160 bags)/ha and puddle into the soil 2 weeks before planting of cow dung or 4tons (80 bags) poultry under irrigated conditions.

**_First application_** transplanting **:** Apply and apply 125kg (2 and a half bags)/ha 180kg (3 and a half bags)/ha of NPK 15-15-15 of 15-15-15,2-3 one week after weeks after

Weeds can be controlled through an integrated use of cultural, manual, mechanical or chemical methods. Weed rice field at 3weeks after seeding or transplanting. The weeds
are controlled by using recommended weedicides and appropriate tools in both upland and lowland rice fields. At 6 week stage, weeds in rice fields are controlled by using th
appropriate tools.

### 7.0 WEED CONTROL/MANAGEMENT

**Roguing**
It is always important to rogue your field to remove ofpurity and achieve the following;ensures genetic purityf-types from the rice field to ensure , ensures high productivity to
farmers, ensures good quality of seeds or grains ensures the requisite adjustment of mill during milling and minimizes percentage of broken grain.

**(iv) Birds** : They attack the crop at the milk and grain filing stage sucking and taking grains out
of the panicles. Birds become a problem from ripening phase when the rice plant is already developing and filling in grains until harvest. Whiteheads can also be caused by stem borer.

Harvesting (reaping), laying refers to all operations cut stalks on stubbles, carried out in the field including bundling, stacking or piling, cutting threshing the rice stalks and
hauling.Harvest variety, and 85 to 90% of the panicles the rice fieldwhen the crops are 80 – 120 days after planting show straw colour yellowish brown and also when the depending on the
grains moisturecontent using the manual process is about 18 - 20%.Harvesting by cutting the panicle and also using the combine can be done in two parts; harvesting harvester, sickles,
slasher and reaper.Cut the stems with a sickle about 10-15cm above the ground.
To mill immediately after harvest, winnow, dry up to 12% to 14% moisture content and
bag.Ifmoisture content is below 12%, parboil before milling to avoidloss throughgrain
breakage.
```
### 9.0 HARVESTING

**Rice harvesting using sickles Rice milling
9.1 Threshing**
Thresh Avoid threshing immediately on bare floor to prevent after harvesting and drying to avoid losses.the introduction of sand, pebbles and other
foreignmaterial.Thresh carefully to avoid dehusking the grains
**9.2 Winnowing**
·· Winnow to separate Remove foreign matter in the paddy to avoid localized the chaff and empty grains from the well filled matured heating spots grains.

**9.3 Drying**
Dry paddy properly clean concrete floors, floors, mats or tarpaulins to a safe content of 13-14% and turning by spreading over periodicallyin a thin layer (2-3cm. Sun- dry for 2 – 3 thick) on
days to reduce breakage during milling. Use a mechanical drier if possible.


```
·· Stop parboiling when the rice husks start to split open.Continuously monitor the paddy
```
```
·· Suspend the bag over steaming water in a drumParboil rice by steaming soaked paddy in a jute bag for 10 to 16 minutes.
```
```
· Parboiled rice has advantages of better storage, cooking qualityvalue, devoid of unpleasant odour and breaking less during milling., being richer in food
```
**9.4 Parboiling**

```
· Soak paddy in hot water at 70^0 C or water hot enough for your fingers to withstand
· the heat for about two seconds. For about 5 to 6 hours discard all floating grains
```

**9.5 Milling**
Milling in the milling is the process process of removing results in whole grains with minimal the husk or hull from the grain and bran Greater broken grains to attract premium efficiency
prices. Mill rice in two stage milling machine. Always mill one pure variety at a time

```
· Keep free from insect attack
```
**9.6 Storage**
·· Store only well cleaned riceInspect rice regularly during storage.
· Avoid storage conditions that allow water penetration
