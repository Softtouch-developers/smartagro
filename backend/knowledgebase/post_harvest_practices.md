1. Introduction

The majority of Ghanaian smallholder farmers rely heavily on crops such as maize, sorghum,
rice, cowpea, groundnuts, soybean and millet. They contribute greatly to the income of rural
households. Despite their potential towards poverty reduction, food security and household
nutrition, yields of farmers’ are usually below the optimum due to a myriad of biotic and abiotic
stresses. Poor access to improved varieties, pests and diseases infestation, low soil fertility and
erratic rainfall are largely responsible for the low on-farm productivity. One of the challenges
farmers grapple with is post-harvest storage losses due to insects. Farmers are forced to sell
their grains at harvest at very low prices rather than risk a total loss.

In addition, high postharvest losses (PHL) have been reported in all districts of Ghana because
farmers use different traditional storage methods which vary in capacity and efficiency. Often
times, such methods are relatively simple and inexpensive to construct and maintain, but are
unable to protect the produce from insect pests, rodents, disease pathogens and moisture
absorption. Effective storage plays a role in stabilizing food supply and prices by widening
seasonal availability. Basic knowledge on the key aspects of a good storage environment,
including a proper storage facility, and the execution of prestorage activities such as harvesting,
drying, threshing or cleaning, will help farmers to meet appropriate conditions to maintain the
quality and quantity of stored grain and seed.

Reducing food losses therefore offers an important pathway of availing food, alleviating
poverty, and improving nutrition. A significant economic benefit of safe grain storage is that
hazard-affected farmers will not be put under pressure to sell their produce in order to meet
their immediate needs; this increases farmers’ bargaining power, as they have the option to
delay selling while negotiating a better price. This will help farmers get a fair price for their
produce and limit the role of middlemen and intermediaries. Further, safe storage can also help
farmers to access credit: farmers can pool their produce, store it and then sell as a group
enabling them to market good quality and large volumes.

### 1.1. Some Postharvest Challenges .......................................................................................

```
✓ Delay in harvesting
✓ Manual and drudgery postharvest operations
✓ Problem of drying due to the release of extra-early maturing varieties
✓ Climate change in relation to rainfall, moisture, relative humidity and temperature
✓ Susceptible to several insects during storage

staff and development partners.
```

2. Postharvest handling of dry grains (durable crops)

Dry grains can be stored for several years once they are harvested on time, dried to safe
moisture content and properly conditioned for storage.

Examples of dry grains: Rice, maize, groundnut, millet, sorghum, cowpea, soybean, bambara
groundnut, Pigeon Pea (Cajanus cajan).

Characteristics of durable crops
✓ They have small grains
✓ Grains have hard texture
✓ They can be dried to low moisture content (< 15% mc)
✓ They have low respiration rate at storage
✓ They can be stored from months to years
✓ Losses are due external factors such as insects, moulds and rodents

General principle for successful storage

The chain of activities to successful storage should include:

1. Observe good agronomic practices before harvest
2. Observe for signs of maturity
3. Harvest timely at maturity
4. Delay in harvest leads to pest infestation, grain moulds, termites and lodging.
5. Dry grain to safe content
6. Properly clean and winnow grain for storage
7. Select appropriate storage method
8. Use recommended grain protectants where insect infestation is suspected
9. Store grain in a good store room or warehouse.

## 3. Harvest Maturity..............................................................................................................

Physiological maturity: means the crop, organ or fruit has attained optimum stage of growth
(morphological, physiological, nutritional or sensory) for consumption. This may be associated
with changes in colour, texture, flavour or size that make them attractive and palatable for
eating.

Harvest maturity: means the crop, organ or fruit has completed growth and sufficiently cured
or dried for harvesting.
NB: This definition depends on the end-use of the crop.

### 3.1. Signs of maturity ................................................................................................

This may vary in different crops. For example.
i. Yellowing and drying of leaves
ii. Drying of maize cob,
iii. Yellowing and drying in cowpea or soybean pods
iv. Yellowing, drying and dropping of sorghum heads
v. Yellowing and browning in rice

## 4. Drying and Safe Moisture Content

Generally, the moisture of stored grain is the most important factor for storage longevity. It is
therefore important to determine the initial moisture content particularly in large scale
warehouse operations. Note the following:
✓ Safe grain moisture content vary in different crops and varieties of same crops.
✓ Safe moisture vary in different agro-ecologies
✓ Safe moisture content may vary depending the method of storage- eg. more dried
grain is recommended in hermitic storage systems
✓ Anticipated length of storage- e.g. more dried grain for prolonged storage
✓ Ventilation system of the storage house
✓ Degree of contamination by foreign materials and plant debris

### 4.1. How to determine grain moisture

Moisture test for dry maize can be done using salt in nylon. Put small quantity of salt and 10-
15 maze grains into nylon and shake. If the maize grain is not dry, you will see wet stains on


the nylon or put some grain in a container (tin), close the container and shake. The louder the
noise the dryer the maize grain. You can also put the grain in-between your teeth, if it breaks
easily; it means the maize grain is dried. If available, moisture meters can be used.

1. By hand-feel based on experience
2. By grain sound based on experience
3. By biting the grain based on experience
4. By using glass and salt test
5. Simple oven drying (laboratory)
6. Use of grain moisture meters.

### 4 .2. Safe moisture content....................................................................................................

It has been well established that for any crop and given temperature, there is a definite relation
between grain moisture content and relative humidity (RH) of the air with which it is in
moisture equilibrium. Relative humidity is the percentage of water vapour in the air between
the grains, and represents the equilibrium between the humidity of the air and the moisture
content of the grain. The grain moisture content in equilibrium with a given RH is called the
equilibrium moisture content at that temperature. If the RH of the air is increased, the grain
will absorb moisture. Accordingly, grains that are exposed to a thin layer of air with fluctuating
humidity absorb and give off moisture, tending at all times to reach equilibrium with the air. If
the relative humidity exceeds 65 percent, mould and storage insects can develop and stored
grain and seed are susceptible to deterioration.
✓ For the dry cereals, when the grain have been dried to safe moisture content or below
the safe moisture level, the grain can be stored for several months or years under a range
of temperature. However, grain moisture must be monitored to minimize moisture rise
or manage such fluctuations.
✓ Sufficiently dried grain is less susceptible to insect infestation and grain moulds.
✓ The safe moisture content vary in different crops, and may vary slightly depending on
the variety.
✓ Also moisture contents are valid for given temperature ranges. Higher temperatures
may require lower grain moisture.

## 5. Managing Grain Moulds and Aflatoxins...............................................................................

Mould (fungi growth) growth and their metabolic activities are a problem during grain storage
in the humid and arid tropical areas. Mould growth can lead to quality losses such as colour,
nutrition, flavour, cooking properties, loss of seed viability and consumer allergies. Of late, the
issue of aflatoxins have also emerged as a major food safety challenge.

The primary cause of mould deterioration of storage grain is the presence of excessive water.
This leads to relative humidity exceeding 70% in the air within the bulk of grain in the store
room. Many fungal mycelia will develop at this relative humidity, thus leading to increase in
biological activity and rapid quality deterioration.

### 5.1. Predisposing Factors

```
✓ Poor soil conditions and fertility
✓ Use of local varieties
✓ High humidity (> 85%), high temperatures (> 25 °C) at growth and storage
✓ Intermittent and end of season droughts,
✓ Insects, termites, millipede and rodent activities,
✓ Delayed harvest and poor drying conditions
✓ intermittent rains during harvest period
✓ Use of improper and traditional storage methods
```
### 5.2. Simple tips to reduce moulds and aflatoxins ...............................................................

```
✓ Timely harvesting is essential
✓ Reduce the harvesting-threshing interval in order to minimize the risk of wet weather
after harvesting
```

```
✓ Harvested produce should be quickly dried to safe storage moisture
✓ The inverted windrowing for drying groundnut pods ensures exposure to direct sunlight
and circulating air. This method can be used for late harvested groundnut only.
✓ Dry on clean platforms or tarpaulin
✓ Store in PICS bags at a dry and ventilated store room
✓ Sort out damaged and mouldy grains/nuts after shelling/threshing
✓ Do not eat mouldy grains/nuts.
```
## 6. Grain Storage Operations......................................................................................................

The main purpose of storage is to keep any produce in excess of immediate consumption or
sale at conditions that maintain grain quality for future use. Any part of harvested food that is
desired for consumption but fail to reach the final consumer is considered as a loss. During the
movement of food from the farm to market or store or consumer table, several types of losses
may occur. These include losses in quality, nutrition, taste and flavour, viability or economic
value. The function of storage is to minimize these losses as much as possible.

### 6.1. Types of storage methods.............................................................................................

1. Traditional methods (Mud-silo, maize barn, crib, baskets)
2. Improved traditional methods (jute bags, poly-bags, mud-silo)
3. Improved small scale methods (e.g. PICS bags, plastic drum, metal silos, community
    bags, Zero-fly bags)
4. Large scale method (grain silo, metal silo, large warehouse )

### 6.2. General Tips for storing most grain..............................................................................

```
✓ Observe proper field drying, solar drying and sun drying
✓ Grain should be dried on a clean platform, cemented floor or tarpaulin sheet
✓ Store at safe moisture content ( 11 - 13.5% moisture).
✓ Select appropriate storage option
✓ The use of PICS bags or plastic drums is now recommended.
✓ For storage of cowpea beyond 3 months or maize, sorghum or millet beyond 6
months, the use of PICS bags should be adopted.
✓ Clear and clean your store room or warehouse.
✓ Disinfect or clean old storage bags thoroughly before use
✓ If the store unit was previously infested, spray or fumigate before loading fresh
produce
✓ After threshing, clean the grain by thorough winnowing
✓ Do not mix old and newly harvested grain
✓ Do not put bags on bare floor
✓ Use only recommended food-grade chemicals with short persistence (e.g. Actellic
Super ( Pyrimiphos-methyl and Permithrin) , or Phostoxin under air-tight conditions).
✓ Adhere to recommended dose on chemical label.
✓ Seek advice from your Agric. Extension Agent.
✓ Conduct regular monitoring and take measures if pest infestation is detected
✓ Monitor market price and sell at appropriate time if price is good.

## 7. Hermitic Grain Storage................................................................................

Hermetic grain storage systems try to eliminate all gaseous exchanges between the inside and
outside of a grain storage container. If the gas exchange is low enough, living organisms such
as insects within the container will deplete oxygen and produce carbon dioxide until they die
or become inactive due to the low oxygen. Hermetic grain storage can be an appropriate
method for many subsistence farmers. It eliminates the need for insecticides, which are costly
and may not be available to farmers. Misuse of insecticides by farmers is common and can
cause health and environmental problems. At low moisture content (below 13 % MC), storage
fungi can be controlled as well.


### 7.1. Purdue Improved Cowpea Storage (PICS) system..........................................

A team of scientist at Purdue University developed the Purdue Improved Cowpea Storage to
reduce losses in Western Africa. The program uses a triple plastic bagging system developed
for storage of cowpeas in West and Central Africa. It was anticipated that up to 50% of the
farmers will stored cowpea in hermetic storage without insecticides by 2012 (Baribusta et al.,
2010).

Procedure
PICS technology uses plastic bags to achieve hermetic storage of cowpeas and other grains.
Threshed cowpea, maize, millet or sorghum grain, dried to an appropriate moisture content and
free of crop debris, is placed into 50 or 100 kg capacity high-density polyethylene bags with
80 - μm thickness. A first bag is filled completely, but with a 20- to 30-cm neck, which is tied
securely. Then, this bag is surrounded by a second bag with the same thickness. The second
bag’s neck is also tied securely. Finally, these two bags are placed in a third woven nylon or
polypropylene bag used for its strength. With the third bag tied securely, the container can be
handled without bursting the inner bags, and is readily accepted by grain handlers who are
accustomed to handling cowpea in this type of woven bag.

### 7.1.1. How to use PICS bags................................................................................................

**_Which grain can be stored?_**
✓ All shelled grain can be stored (except paddy rice),
✓ E.g. Maize, cowpea, soybean, millet, sorghum

**_Advantages_**
✓ High quality grain after storage (insect free grain)
✓ Does not require the addition of chemicals
✓ Grain can be stored for 1-3 three years
✓ Does not affect seed viability

**_Disadvantages_**
✓ High cost of bags
✓ Problem of re-usability
✓ Not available at many districts and communities

### 7.1.2. Steps to use the PICS bags.........................................................................................

**Step 1:**

```
✓ Obtain PICS bags from input dealers
✓ Store only properly dried grain
✓ Clean grain thoroughly be winnowing
✓ Remove plant debris by hand.
```

**Step 2:**

```
✓ Separate the 3 bags apart
✓ Check the 2 inner plastic bags to ensure there is no perforation
✓ Do not use bags that have perforations.
```
Step 3
✓ Fill the inner bag with grain to the neck
✓ Start with small quantity of grain, shape gently to allow for proper filling
✓ Make sure there is no air pocket at bottom
✓ Hand press gently to remove all air bubbles
✓ Allow some space to enable tying of bags


(^)
Step 4
✓ Twist, fold and tie the inner bag first
✓ Pull up the second bags and follow same steps for 2nd and 3rd layers.
✓ You may tie with a robe or clean cloth.
Step 5
✓ Store in cool dry room.
✓ Do not store bags on a bare floor.
✓ Do not open bags regularly
✓ Monitor prices of grain in markets
✓ Sell your grain when prices are good


```
Do not store bags on a bare floor
Store on raised wooden platform or racks.

7. Conclusion

Postharvest grain loss is a significant barrier to household food nutrition security across
Ghana. These losses can be aggravated in times of natural disasters such as drought, floods or
pests, leading to devastating effects at household level, undermining the capacity of rural
communities to overcome these crises and impeding an early recovery after the shock. The
implementation of appropriate storage systems, both methods and facilities, have therefore an
important role in an increased resilience for rural communities.

The storage of grain and seed needs to be addressed from a value-chain perspective, as some
of the main factors that impact storage start in the field (preharvest) and in the handling of the
produce before the storage (postharvest handling). To ensure the right execution of prestorage
activities such as harvesting, drying, threshing or cleaning, among other operations, will help
farmers to meet appropriate storage conditions, as well as reduce the risk of insects being
taken inside the storage facility.

An important part of the efforts to reduce insect infestation and mould development in the
stored grain are centred on ensuring stable and appropriate conditions of low temperature and
relative humidity inside the storage facility, as well as keeping the moisture content of the
stored grain and seed under safe thresholds.

As a complement to this, the implementation of preventive principles of IPM and appropriate
conception and construction of storage facilities will help to reduce the risk of a pest
infestation and the associated losses, leading to a significant improvement of small-scale
farmers’ economy and food and nutrition security
