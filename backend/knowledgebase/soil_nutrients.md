## INTRODUCTION

### Current situation of soils in Ghana

Productivity of Ghana’s cropland remains low and continues to reduce due to several factors.
Some of these include:

- Inherent low soil fertility status
- Bad adoption of soil management practices (e.g. low/excessive use of fertilizers, deep
    ploughing, ploughing along the slope, complete burning of farm waste, etc.)
- Untimely performance of field operations
- Bush burning
- Reduction in fallow periods.

### How to Improve Soil Productivity

Soil productivity can be improved through the adoption of one or more of the following:

- Prudent and effective soil management practices (selecting suitable soils, good
    conservation measures, etc.)
- Improved and effective water management practices (mulching, bunding, ridging
    across slopes, etc.)
- Improved and effective nutrient management (use of inorganic/organic fertilizers,
    appropriate farming /cropping systems, etc.) practices
- Soil conditioners (e.g. biochar)
- Periodic soil testing to assess fertility status, identification of limiting nutrients and
    pollutants.

### Effect of Climate Change and Variability on Soil Fertility/Productivity

- Climate change is resulting in changes in rainfall patterns and intensity (drought and
    floods)
- Climate change is resulting in high temperatures
- Such changes invariably affect the soil and its ability to support crop growth.

```
1.4 Measures to Mitigate/Adapt to Effects of Climate Change
```
- Farmers must adopt effective soil, water and nutrient management strategies that can
    improve crop production (e.g. mulching, bunding, ridging, suitable crop varieties,
    good agronomic practices, etc.)
- Reliance on Agro-meteorological information and other early warning systems


- Practice conservation agriculture (cover cropping, rotations, relay cropping, etc.)
- Early warning systems emergency preparedness

## EFFECTIVE SOIL AND WATER MANAGEMENT PRACTICES FOR CROPLANDS

# FOR CROPLANDS

Some recommended ways in which the soil must be managed to ensure continuous and
sustainable use are:

### Proper site selection for crop production

- Consider that soils in Ghana vary in properties and potentials to support crop
    production.
- Agro-ecological zones in Ghana have different environmental and climatic
    characteristics, thus affecting soil properties
- Various crops have specific soil requirements and at different degrees for a successful
    production.
- For most crops, soil that are deep, well-drained and gentle sloping are most suitable.

Note: Farmers are encouraged to seek advice from nearest extension offices or consider
the above factors in selecting the cropping sites.

### Land preparation

- All land preparation practices should not expose the soil to severe erosion and
    removal of top soil (e.g. Ploughing across slopes);
- Constant use of heavy machinery causes sub-soil compaction and/or increased erosion
- Land preparation practices must be undertaken early enough during the cropping
    season

Considerations for good land preparation

- Adoption of no or limited burning (always maintain some vegetative cover)
- Slashing and de-stumping are recommended for areas with thick vegetative cover.
- The use heavy machinery such as bulldozers to clear land including topsoil removal
    is never recommended under any circumstances for agricultural land preparation.


- Levelling may be required when/where necessary (should only be done within the
    topsoil to create uniformity on soil surface)
- Avoid deep ploughing in shallow soils
- Practice minimum tillage
- Plough across the slope and not along it
- Minimize the use of heavy equipment in land preparation where it cannot be avoided.

### Management and Maintenance of Croplands

Croplands must always be protected and nurtured to provide a very conducive environment
for the sustainable growth of the crops.
Strategies for good Cropland Management

- Always maintain adequate vegetative cover (preferably dry material as mulch)
- Apply adequate plant nutrients at the right time
- Adopt practices that improve soil organic matter content (e.g. mulching, application
    of organic manures, crop rotations, etc.)
- Adopt practices that improve water conservation (e.g. strip cropping, bunding,
    terracing, mulching)
- Adopt effective weed control measures.
- Adopt recommended erosion control measures.
- Drain off standing/stagnant water where not needed
- Protect the cropland from strong winds by creating wind breaks
- Protect and stabilise the banks of water courses in and around the cropland

Note: Minimal or macro levelling may be necessary to prevent/reduce water collection at
particular points under upland conditions

## SOME SIMPLE IRRIGATION PRACTICES FOR SMALLHOLDER CROPLANDS

# CROPLANDS

The amount, duration and frequency of water applied to a specific crop field must be based
on the crop’s requirement, soil conditions and other environmental factors.
Famers may ensure adequate water availability to their fields through the following measures:

- Grow water intensive crops in the valleys (e.g. dry season vegetable farming)


- Construct dykes/weirs and associated channels to manage water resources for
    agriculture
- Create hand dug wells/ponds to harvest flood/rain water for crops
- Adopt bunding, terracing, strip cropping, agroforestry etc. to conserve soil moisture

### EFFECTIVE SOIL NUTRIENT MANAGEMENT FOR CROPLANDS

Providing adequate soil nutrients in the required forms, quantities and at the right time is
essential for good crop growth and optimum yields

# 4.0 WHAT IS A PLANT NUTRIENT?

- Plant nutrient is any natural or artificial substance containing chemical elements (e.g.
    N, P, K, Ca Mg. etc.) that improve crop growth.
- Some of these nutrients can be supplied by natural means (existing within the soil)
    while others may have to be supplied through artificial additions (fertilizers).
- Others may be supplied through effective cropping systems

```
4.1 Why add Plant Nutrients to the Soil?
```
- They are needed because plants depend on them to grow and provide good yields
    (food for mankind).
- In general, fertility status of soils in Ghana is inherently low and any successful crop
    production effort must be supported by the addition of adequate nutrients.
- There is low fertilizer use (< 15kg ha-^1 ) in crop production in Ghana, causing soil
    nutrient mining (removal without replacement).
- The end result is low crops yield, shortage of food, hunger and rural poverty.
4. 2 Types of Plant Nutrients
There are several types of plant nutrients.
These can be broadly grouped into three categories depending on the quantities required by
plants for normal growth and yield:
(i) Macro nutrients - required in large quantities (N, P, K)
(ii) Secondary nutrients - required in medium quantities (Ca, Mg, Na, S)
(iii) Micro nutrients – required in very small quantities (Zn, B, Fe, Mn,
etc.)


4.3 Sources of Plant Nutrients
Crop nutrients can come from several sources. Notably among these are
(i) Natural sources (in the parent materials/rocks that formed the soil)
(ii) Organic sources (farm and domestic residues, natural vegetation) and
(iii) Inorganic sources (mineral fertilizers)

## NATURAL SOURCES TO IMPROVE/MAINTAIN SOIL FERTILITY

# FERTILITY

Basically, these are nutrients supplied by parent material during weathering of rocks

### Organic Fertilizer Sources to Improve/Maintain Soil Fertility

Most plant and animal residues are great sources of plant nutrients that can be harnessed to
support crop production. In addition, several systems can also help improve soil fertility.
Some of these include:

- Composting
- Mulching
- Green manuring
- Crops rotation,
- Relay cropping
- Intercropping
- Strip cropping (see plate 1)
- Farm yard manure (FYM)

```
Plate 1: Cowpea - cassava strip cropping
```

- Direct application of plant residue (straw from rice, maize, sorghum, etc.)

```
➢ Apply about 3-5 t/ha plant residue depending on availability and quality
➢ Apply plant residue both in the raw form or when decomposed
➢ The commonest farm residues in Ghana are rice and maize straw.
➢ These materials are rich in plant nutrients.
```
```

```
Advantages of adding farm residues to soil:

- Increase the soil’s ability to hold water and makes the soil easier to till
- Help soil to retain more of the plant nutrients.
- Supply most of the nutrients needed by crops.
- Help to reduce the adverse effects of excessive alkalinity, acidity, or the excessive
    use of chemical fertilizer.
- Aid in preventing soil erosion by keeping the soil covered.
- Help in controlling the growth of weeds.

### Inorganic Fertilizer Sources to Improve/Maintain Soil Fertility

These are mostly mineral fertilizer materials synthetically manufactured for crop production.
There are several types based on their composition and make. Some of these include:

- Straight/single fertilizers (e.g. urea, sulphate of ammonia, super phosphates, muriate
    of potash, sulphate of potash)
- Compound fertilizers (e.g. NPK of various combinations)


# 6.0 FERTILIZER APPLICATION TECHNIQUES/METHODS

Fertilizers may be applied in several ways or methods based on type and form.
For Organic Sources,

- work material into soil during land preparation (cereals, roots, tubers, legumes, tree
    crops)
- place materials around and/or at the base of growing crop (vegetables, tree crops)
- foliar application
- through irrigation water

For Inorganic Sources

- broadcast (spread uniformly on soil surface or field e.g. lowland rice)
- band placement (place around growing crops and cover e.g. maize)
- deep placement (place deep inside soil using special tools/equipment)
- Within the plant hole
- Foliar application
- Through irrigation water

### Fertilizer Application Rates

- Application rates are normally based on a recommendation rate which has been
    scientifically established through field experimentation.
- Each crop has a specific recommendation based on its requirement and growing
    environment
- As such, fertilizer recommendations must be specific based on soil type and growing
    environment (agro-ecology)
- Blanket recommendations for all crops across agro-ecological zones does not provide
    for crops to give optimum yields.
- Some current recommendation rates are:
    Maize: 100- 40 - 40 N-P 2 O 5 - K 2 O kg per hectare for savanna ecology
       Equivalent to 4 bags NPK + 3 Bags Urea):
       90 - 60 - 60 (N-P 2 O 5 - K 2 O) kg per hectare for transition ecology,


```
Equivalent to 6 bags NPK + 2 bags Urea.
Rice: 90- 60 - 60 (N-P 2 O 5 - K 2 O) kg hectare for lowland ecology
Equivalent to 6 bags NPK + 2 Bags Urea
```
## INTEGRATED SOIL FERTILITY MANAGEMENT (ISFM) FOR CROPLANDS

# CROPLANDS

This is the management of soil fertility to enhance and sustain cropland productivity through
the adoption/application of two or more soil fertility management practices:
e.g. mineral fertilizer application + manure application + suitable cropping systems + suitable
crop variety (considering local conditions).

### Suggested options of ISFM for selected crops
