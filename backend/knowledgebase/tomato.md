### 1.0 INTRODUCTION

**Botanical name:** _Lycopersicumesculentum/Solanumlycopersicum_
Tomato _(SolanumlycopersicumL._ ) is the most important fruit vegetable in Ghana and a good
source of Vitamins A and C and other minerals for improved nutrition. The seeds also contain
about 24% oil and this is extracted for use as salad oil and in the manufacture of margarine. It is
also an important cash crop for most farmers.

```
Typical tomato farm
2.0 GROWING REQUIREMENT
Ensure that site selected must have a well distributed rainfall of between 300-600mm.
```
```
· Ensure the soils are well-drained and fertile
```
```
Optimal temperatures for growing tomato are between 22°C and 28°C during the day and
between 18°C and 22°C at night. Relative humidity of between 60 - 80% is most suitable.
Select well drained soil on a gentle slope. They are very sensitive to water logged soils and
prefer a soil pH of between 6.0 -7.0.Below a pH of 6.0 add rock phosphate, poultry manure or
lime. Above pH7.0 seek professionalguidance in amending your soil pH.Hot dry spells
followed by heavy rains cause the mature fruits to crack.
```
```
· Select easily assessable sites close to a permanent water source of good quality. Always
make provision for supplementary irrigation.
```
```
· Choose areas that allow adequate sunshine required for optimal plant growth
· Select flat and gently sloping land to prevent run-off.
```
### 3.0 SITE SELECTION


```
· Tropimech, Rio
```
```
· Avoid fields previously planted or intercropped with solanaceous crops (e.g. tomato,
pepper, garden eggs, cassava, potato) for the past two cropping seasons.
· Rotate tomato with unrelated crops e.g. rice, maize, sorghum, millet, onion, garlic,
cowpea, groundnut and cotton. This will help reduce pest and disease incidence.
· Avoid areas with rocks and many trees. Rocks and trees can impede movement of farm
implements and make land preparation and crop establishment difficult.
```
**4.0 SEED/VARIETAL SELECTION:**

Select improved seeds (early maturing, resistance to common tomato diseases etc.) from dealer
source and other Institutions such as CSIR-Crops Research Institute, Ministry of Food and
Agriculture etc.

**Examples of Recommended and Improved Varieties**
· Roma VFN,
· Pectomech VF,

```
· Grande,
· Jaguar,
· Lindo,
· Titao Derma,
· Ada Cocoa.
```
**4.1 Nursery establishment**

```
· Do a germination test before nursery to avoid wasting resources (eg. Seeds, time etc.)
(sow seeds when > 80%)
```
```
· Raise all seedlings under protected structures such as simple net houses or net tunnels
before they reach the hardening stage.
· The nursery should be located in a flat area that is secure and accessible, to allow close
```
```
· Raise tomato seedlings in seed trays or boxes or seed beds.
```
```
· Treat with recommended seed dressing (NB: seeds from certified sources are pre-
treated).
```
```
· Nurse 300-450g of tomato seeds to produce enough seedlings per hectare (30,000-
plants per ha) for planting.
```

```
· Boost seedlings with Mono Ammonium Phosphate (MAP) at 10g/15L Knapsack after 14
days
```
A thorough land preparation is important in enhancing early crop establishment and adequate
weed control.

```
· Apply 10g/15L knapsack of 19-19-19 (NPK) (10 days) after germination
```
```
· Thoroughly water the seedlings about 12 hours before transplanting to the field.
```
### 5.0 LAND PREPARATION

```
· In the absence of poultry manure, apply cow dung or other animal droppings at a
rate of 30-40ton/ha.
```
```
monitoring.
```
```
o Southern Ghana-March-April (Major season), August (Minor season) and
September- October for Irrigated sites
```
```
· Do spot burning when the debris is thick after slashing.
```
```
o Northern Ghana- July (Rainy season) or Sept-October (irrigated sites)
```
```
· Prepare ridges or bed across the contours on which seedlings may be transplanted.
```
**5.1 Nursery management**

```
· Plough and harrow across the slope to a fine tilth (double plough if necessary).
```
```
· Demarcate a suitable location and clear the land
```
```
· Clear the vegetation - fell trees and remove the stumps where necessary.
```
```
· sterilize the soil by burning dry grass on the cleared land
```
```
NB! This should be ploughed in 4-5weeks before planting (spot or row application
can also be done).
```
**(a) Prepare the seed bed**

```
· work out the soil to a fine tilt and raise a bed of 1x5x 0.5m and get the bed ready for
```
```
· Incorporate well decomposed poultry manure at the rate of 20-30ton/ha at land at
land preparation may be beneficial to plant growth and development.
```
```
seeding.
```
```
· Depending on the onset of rain land preparation should be done as follows,
```

Seeds can be sown on seed beds or in seed trays or seed boxes. Prepare seed beds at 1.2m wide
and at any convenient length and then level beds. Sow seeds in drills 10cm apart. Cover beds
with well dried non seeded grass or palm fronds. After emergence remove dry grass and provide
shade over the bed.

```
Tomato at the nursery
```
```
Transplanting of seedlings should be done 3-4 weeks after emergence on the field at 5-leaf
stage. Planting should be done preferably early in the morning or late in the afternoon to
increase chances of survival.. One week before transplanting, harden seedlings by decreasing
shade until at least 1 day full exposure to sunlight and/or reducing irrigation. Use a spacing of
60cm x 50cm (dry season/determinate/semi-determinate growth habit) and 100cm x 50cm
(rainy season/Indeterminate growth habit)
```
```
Staking helps raise the developing tomato fruit off the ground while caging lets the plants
hold itself upright.

### 6.0 FERTILIZER APPLICATION

### 7.0 WEED CONTROL/MANAGEMENT

```
· Use soil test as a guide to fertilizer application. A guideline to fertilizer application will
include: The table below is a general recommendation. For a yield of 40tons/ha tomato
requires about 96kg of N, 16kg of P 0, 144kg of K 0, 68kg of Ca, 24kg of Mg and 24kg of 2 s 2
S. Apply foliar fertilizer to supply adequate amount of boron and manganese to enhance
crop quality and yield
```
```
· Pre-mix 32kg Nitrogen and 16kg Phosphorus with the well-decomposed poultry manure
at the rate of 20-30ton/ha of poultry manure or 30-40ton/ha of cow dung or other animal
droppings as basal.
```
```
· Weekly application of micro-nutrients (Iron, Zinc, Copper, Molybdenum, Boron,
Manganese) should be applied to foster better plant development.
```
Timely weed control is necessary for healthy crop growth. This may be achieved by frequent
shallow weeding. Application of pre-emergence weedicides 3-4 days before transplanting will
enhance weed control.

### 8.0 PESTS & DISEASES MANAGEMENT

**Signs and Symptoms**

They multiply quickly so it is important to manage them early before reproduction starts. Many
generations can occur in one season. Most potyviruses (the largest group of plant viruses) are
transmitted by aphids.

```
· Curled, wrinkled or cupped leaves
```
**(a) Insect Pests**

```
· Presence of immobile aphids on the underside of leaves, shoots and stems
```
**(i)Aphids -** Aphids remove sap from the plant with their piercing-sucking mouthparts.

```
· Honeydew on infested crop
```

```
Aphids on the underside of leaves Aphids damage
```
```
· Observe underside of leaves for aphid's presence
```
```
· Avoid too much nitrogen which makes plant to be very succulent and attractive to
aphids
```
```
Prevention
```
```
Management
```
```
· Grow repellent plants like onions, garlic and marigold in alternating rows to prevent
aphids
```
```
· Intercrop with resistant species such as onion, garlic and parsley to reduce aphid
populations
```
**Monitoring**
· Start monitoring from seedling stage, look at lower leaves, stems or growing points for
soft bodied insects, found in clusters

```
· Conserve natural enemies (e.g. ladybird beetles, hoverflies and Aphidius sp.) by
avoiding spraying broad spectrum insecticides
```
```
· Regularly check for leaf curling and sticky residue on crops at least once a week
```
```
· When monitoring crops, sample the most recently expanded leaves (4th or 5 leaf from th
the growing point) to give an estimated threshold
```

```
· Remove and burn infected/infested plants to help reduce aphid populations
```
```
· Spray with botanical extracts e.g. garlic, neem, red chilli pepper or soap (take 50g mix
in 2 L of water. Boil for 15 minutes, allow to cool and spray 3 times at 2 weeks'
interval)
```
```
· Dot-like scars on fruit
```
**Control**

```
· Eggs of fruit fly inside the skin of the fruit
```
```
· Spray soap solution (Potassium soaps e.gAlatasamina) (add 10-15 tablespoons of
liquid soap in 15L and spray on foliage
```
```
· Prune leaves showing symptoms (curling, aphid populations on underside)
```
```
· There are many predators and parasitoids that can aid in controlling aphid populations.
These include lady beetles, syrphid fly larvae, damsel bugs, and tiny wasps.
```
**(ii)Fruit flies
Signs and Symptoms**

```
· Larvae (maggots) feeding inside the fruit when cut open
· Check for rotten and fallen fruits
· Presence of adult flies on the field
```
```
Adult fruit fly on tomato fruit Fruit fly maggot inside the
```

```
Prevention
· Avoid planting pepper near alternate hosts (mango, citrus, watermelons, tomatoes,
eggplants, avocado) to reduce pest populations
· Remove non-harvested pepper and wild melon pumpkins as they will host larvae. Bury
15 to 30 cm deep
```
**Management**

```
· For early detection, use commercial pheromone traps with trimedlure (TML), or
cuelure (CL), or methyl eugenol (ME) attractants (3traps/ km )^2
```
```
Direct control
· Collect dropped fruits and bury them outside the field at a depth of 60cm with plastic
bags
· Use food baits e.g. waste brewers' yeast at 45ml/L of water
```
```
· Till the fields top soil (5 to 10cm deep) before planting to expose pupae to the sun,
birds, poultry and parasites
```
```
Monitoring
· Start monitoring as soon as fruit begins to develop. Inspect plants weekly to look for
brownish or yellowish wasp-like flies on plants.
```
```
during the day
```
```
· Exit holes on surface of fruits
· Adult moths are observed underneath leaves. They are silvery, grey brown and
```
```
Signs and Symptoms
```
```
thin
```
```
· For early detection use commercial pheromone traps with trimedlure, cue lure or
methyl eugenol (3 traps/50m^2 )
```
```
(iii) Tomato leaf miner ( Tutaabsoluta ) - Tutaabsoluta is a small moth which mines
```
```
· Spray Success Appat (food bait+spinosad (0.24g/l) The spray should contain ½ cup
(150ml) of the bait mixed with 5L water. Protection lasts 8 days
```
```
· Look out for eggs on leaves and stem
```
```
and gradually become brown and necrotic
```
```
tomato leaves as a caterpillar. The moth is active at night and hides between leaves
```
```
· Mines (galleries) and droppings on leaves, stems and fruit. Leaf mines are wide
```
```
· Fruit mines rot
```

```
Damage on fruit Damage on leaf
```
```
· Seal door frames and window frames with insect-proof netting (with mesh less than
1.6mm)
```
```
· Tools should be cleaned after use in infested fields
```
**Prevention**

```
· Avoid staggered tomato cropping because Tutaabsoluta moths can fly from an
infested crop to previously uninfested crop
```
**Monitoring**

**Control**

```
· Remove and destroy weeds that act as alternative host plants e.g. Datura, Solanum
```
```
· Avoid rotation with, or planting near solanaceous crops such as eggplants, potatoes,
tomatoes and capsicum since these crops can be hosts of Tutaabsoluta. Instead rotate
with non-host plants such as maize, beans and cabbages
```
```
· Remove infested tomato plant materials and destroy by burning or burying in holes
more than 50cm deep.
```
```
· Remove infested tomato plant materials and destroy by burning or burying in holes
more than 50 cm deep. Do not dump infested fruits at farm edges, collection points
```
**Management**

```
· Use pest-free transplants. Inspect new seedlings carefully before they are
transplanted into the field or under shelter
```
```
· Use Pheromone traps, light traps or sticky traps to detect the pest early
```

· Destroy plant residues after harvest by burning or burying
· Inspect harvesting containers, field boxes or carts, packaging material and destroy or
disinfect if tomato leafminer is suspected

**(iv)Whitefly (** **_Bemisiatabaci_** **) –** Adults are sucking insects. The body and wings are covered in
a powdery waxy secretion, white to slightly yellowish in colour

**Signs and Symptoms**
· Look for leaves with whitefly groups mainly on the underside of leaves. They usually
fly when you shake the plants

```
or in markets
```
· Yellowing, curling, crumpling of leaves and occurs at heavy infestation

```
· Keep the field weed-free throughout the cropping season since weeds act as alternate
host and can harbor whitefly-transmitted viruses
```
```
Prevention
```
```
· Conserve natural enemies (wasps, ladybirds) by mulching or leaving a natural hedge
of flowering plants (e.g. Thiona, Lantana) along the edges to offer them refuge
```
```
· Remove tomato residues and volunteer tomatoes and bury or burn
```
```
Management
```
```
· Transplant shortly after or during the rainy season
```
```
· Plant repellent crops such as Coriander or Mexican marigold after 3-4 rows of
tomato to repel the whiteflies
```
```
Whitefly on underside of leaf Whitefly damage
```

**Symptoms**

· Dark shriveled stems around the base and brown rotten roots

**Control**

**(i) Damping off:** It is a rot that occurs at soil level of the young crop (seedling stage) and it is
caused by fungi.

**Monitoring**

· Wilting, collapse and death of seedlings

· Conserve natural enemies. Several wasps, including species in the _Encarsia_ and
_Eretmocerus_ genera which parasitize whiteflies

**(b) DISEASES**

· Use yellow sticky traps at about 1 per 5 plants

· Spray Azadirachtin 0.03% (50ml/20L water) 15 days after transplant
· Use hot pepper spray. Put cut pepper in warm water. Soak for 1 day. Dilute in 10L water
and add 20 drops of liquid soap before spraying


**Management
Prevention**
· Solarize the soil of nursery beds before planting using clear plastic to sterilize. If the
problem persists, consider changing nursery sites
· Clean or disinfect tools (tillers, cutlasses and hoes) using 10% bleach solution or fire to
heat
· Sow seeds thinly to ensure aeration. Plant in raised beds to maintain good drainage and
avoid over watering

Presence of lesions with chlorotic margins on leaves

Dark brown to black circular or angular spots on leaflets with concentric zones

**(ii)Early blight (** **_Alternariasolani_** **):** Attacks seedlings at the seedbed stage. High
temperatures may favour disease incidence. The leaf blight phase usually begins on the
lower, older leaves and progresses up the plant. Infected leaves eventually wither, die, and
fall from the plant.

· Treat seed with Mancozeb 800g/kg, Folpet 500g/l at 3-4g/kg

· Avoid excessive fertilization at nursery to reduce damping off

**Symptoms**

**Control**

· Remove infected plants as soon as symptoms appear and destroy them away from nursery

Black or brown sunken lesions on fruits

```
Damage on leaf
```

**Prevention**

```
· Disinfect hands and tools with detergent or household bleach after working on the infected
plants
```
```
· Remove and destroy crop debris after harvest and solanaceous weeds that may act as hosts
```
```
· Carry diseased materials to be destroyed away in a closed container to prevent spread of
the disease
```
```
· Practice staking and mulching to prevent the fruit from touching the soil and to improve
```
**(iii)Fusariumwilt :** The fungus lives indefinitely in the soil and is spread in irrigation water. It
is very susceptible to changes in temperature and soil moisture. The optimum temperature for
disease development is 24 -27oC. The wilt does not occur in dry soil, but it is serious in poorly
drained fields.

**Management**

```
· Rotate tomato with cereals (e.g. maize) or legumes (cowpea or groundnut) every two
seasons. Observe good agricultural practice

```
aeration.
```
**Control**

```
· Remove and burn infected plant detected early
```
```
· Apply Mancozeb at a rate of 24-32g/ 15 L knapsack
```
**Signs and Symptom**
· Yellowing, and wilting of leaves and stems, often only affecting one side of the
plant
· Wilted leaves which dry up and turn brown
· Uproot and cut the stem lengthwise, internal dark brown to dark-red
discoloration can be seen when the fungus is present
· There may also be damage on the root system

**Control**
· Rogue out and destroy plants that show early symptoms of the disease and destroy by

**(iv)Nematodes (Root-Knot Nematodes)
Signs and Symptoms**

**Prevention**
· Avoid planting on land with history of wilt disease

**Management**

```
· Rotate nursery site each season and maintain good drainage
· Destroy plant debris immediately after harvest by burning
· Solarize soil using plastic sheets 6-8 weeks before planting
```
```
· Stunted growth and zones of poor growth on the farm soon after transplanting
· Uproot affected plants to examine the root system and check for galls and swellings
```

```
Prevention
```
```
· Farm tools (e.g. cutlasses) should be washed of soil particles after use
```
```
· Plant marigolds (e.g. Targetespatula ) on fields for two months after harvest, plough into
soil before transplanting seedlings
```
```
· Rogue and burn affected plants with typical nematode symptoms at early stages of plant
growth
```
```
Management
```
```
· Do not transfer nematodes into a clean area when transplantingby reducing movement
of soil particles after use
· Expose ploughed land 2-3 weeks before transplanting, this may help to reduce nematode
numbers
```
```
· Rotate for 2 years with non-host crops: sorghum, millet. Broccoli or cauliflower
```
```
· Control weeds and volunteer crops or solanaceous plants
```
```
Control
```
```
· Applications of poultry manure or cow dung at a rate of 5t/ha can boost crop vigour and
reduce nematode infestations on the crop
```
### 9.0 HARVESTING

```
· Tomatoes ripen in 60-85 days from the time seedlings are set out depending on the
variety. When the fruits begin to turn red, check the plants every day and pick those that
are fully red and firm, but not hard. Fruits
· Harvest at breaker or fully-ripened firm stage depending on market segment
```
```
· Nematicides (chemicals) used in controlling nematodes are generally poisonous and
expensive. Avoid recommending chemical control with Nematicides. Encourage use of
```

```
· Keep produce under shade or in a cool environment immediately after harvest to remove
field-heat.
```
```
requirement.
· Observe strict hygiene during harvesting operations.
· Harvest carefully to avoid damaging the produce.
```
**9.1 Yield**

**9.2 Marketing**

```
· Never placed tomatoes on the sun to ripen, they may rot before they arrive.
```
```
· Sort and pack stackable wooden crates lined with foam or dry straw.
```
```
The fruit should be firm and free from blemishes or any damage before marketing. Fruits are
harvested at mature green stage or full ripe but firm stage depending on market demand and
distance. Tomatoes can be marketed in raw state or processed into paste and put in a sealed
container.
```
```
Yield varies greatly with cultivar and adherence to Good Agricultural Practices. Yields of up to
35-40 tons/ha are achievable.
```
