### 1.0 INTRODUCTION

**Botanical name** : _Capsicum annuum (sweet)_ and _Capsicum frutescens (hot)_

Alongside tomato and onion, peppers chilli ranks as one of Ghana's three most important
vegetable crops in terms of hectares and crop value with significant potential for generating
income, creating jobs, and contributing to foreign exchange through exportsPepper can be
produced in the field and under greenhouse farming using conventional organic procedures.

```
Typical Pepper farm
2.0 GROWING REQUIREMENTS
```
```
Select well drained soil on a gentle slope with a pH of 5.0-7.0 (slightly acidic to
neutral)peppers require sunny, semi-tropic or tropical conditions and annual rainfall of
between 600mm to 1,250mm. Low humidity will result in bad fruit set due to dropping of
flower buds. The ideal temperature for good growth is between 18-32ºC.
```
```
3.0 SITE SELECTION
```
```
· Select an open site with a deep, well-drained sandy loam soil or clay loam soil.
· Choose soils with a pH range of 5 –7.
```
```
· Select sites easily accessible by vehicles and other farm machines.
```
```
· Choose sites with annual rainfall of between 300-600mm well distributed throughout
```
```
· Select sites located close to a reliable source of quality water.
```

```
the year.
· Choose sites with annual rainfall of between 300-600mm well distributed throughout the
year.
· Site should have gentle slope, ideally land with1- 2% inclination
· Site must have a temperature range from 24-32°C.
· Avoid sandy and heavy clay soils. (Clay soils have poor drainage capacity and hence
prone to water-logging.)
· Avoid sites previously cropped with plants in the same family asPepper e.g. tomato,
garden eggs etc.
```
Use certified, high-yielding pepper seeds from recommended Agro-Input dealers.
Decision on which variety to cultivate must be based on target market.

```
· No foreign matter e.g. weeds seeds, dead insects, stones etc.
```
```
· Date of packaging
```
```
· Well packaged and properly labelled. The labels should provide the following
information:
· Variety
```
```
· Percentage germination
· Percentage purity
· Seed treatment
· Net weight
```
```
I. (Hot)- Legon 18, Long Red Cayenne, Bird's eye (improved variety is called
Demon which is good for export), M12, Scotch Bonnet, KpakpoShito,
Jalapeno, Habanero, Fresno.
```
### 4.0 SEED/VARIETALSELECTION

```
· Virus and disease resistant
· High germination percentage i.e. between 95- 100%
```
**Good quality pepper seeds must have the following characteristics:**

```
Some Suitable varieties
```
```
· No pest or mechanical damage.
```
```
· Producer's name
```

```
Long red cayenne KpakpoShito (bomb/cherry pepper)
```
**Scotch bonnet (Red) Scotch bonnet (green)**

```
Birds eye Habanero
```
```
i. (Sweet)- King Arthur, Florida Giant, California Wonder, Red Knight, Early Carl
Wonder, Chinese Wonder, Yolo Giant.
```

```
· The nursery must be located close to the farm.
```
```
· The site should be well drained and free from troublesome weeds like (nut-grass and
spear grass).
```
```
· Raise the bed for about 15-20cm above the ground level to allow good drainage.
```
```
· Sterilize the soil by heaping dry grass on it and spot burn to control most soil borne
diseases and pests.
```
**Determining a good nursery site:**

**Seedbed Preparation**

**4.1Nursery Establishment**

```
· Nursery must be located near a good permanent source of water.
· The nursery should be located about 20 meters away from pepper, tomato and garden
egg plants to prevent transmission of diseases to the seedlings.
```
```
· Good sanitation must be practiced at the nursery. (All trash must be burnt between each
production cycle.)
```
**Steps in preparing a proper seedbed:**
· Prepare seed bed by digging 15 cm deep and breaking up the lumps into fine tilth.

```
· Make sure the surface of the bed is smooth and remove all stones, roots, and weeds.
· Bed size should be 1m wide by any convenient length.
```
```
· If the area has been continuously cropped spread one bucket of well-decomposed
animal manure (poultry manure or cow dung) on a bed of size 1m×10m.
· Mix soil and manure, then water thoroughly and leave for one week before nursing.
· For one hectare plot an area of 71.5square meters may be needed for the nursery. This
area should be divided into four beds 1m×10m each. Leave an alley of 0.5m wide
between beds and at the ends of the beds to allow for easy movement within and around
beds.

### 5.0 LAND PREPARATION

```
Process for Preparing the Land
```
**5.1 Nursery Management**

```
· Plough across the slope to a depth of 20-30cm and harrow to a fine tilth (double plough if
necessary).
· Incorporate well decomposed poultry manure at the rate of 20-30ton/ha at land
preparation preferably between the first and second ploughing. In the absence of poultry
manure, apply cow dung or other animal droppings at a rate of 30-40ton/ha. This should
be ploughed in 4-5weeks before planting (NB: spot or row application can also be done).
· In low lying areas plant peppers on ridges. Create ridges of 100 cm width and 15 cm
height. Distant between ridges should be 60 cm apart.
```
**5.1.1Germination test.**

```
· Sow fifty (50) Pepper seeds in a germination tray or a small nursery bed
```
Before sowing/nursing seeds perform a germination test to know the viability level of the
seed.For commercial production reject any seed below 70 %. For a demonstration where
quantities needed are low such seed may be accepted if that is the only one available. However,
in real terms, i.e. commercial productions do not go below germination percentage of 85%.

```
· Place the tray in a warm area and keep it moist.
```
**Seed rate:** 100-150g (approximately 30,000 seeds) is required to plant 1 ha depending on
variety, seed viability and spacing.

```
· Late germinators are weak seeds, reject them.
· Determine the viability rate (germination percentage) by dividing the number of seeds
that germinated by number of seeds sown (50) and multiply by 100.
```
```
· Between 5- 8 days count all seeds that germinate for cayenne and 8 -12 days for scotch
bonnet and cherry pepper seeds,
```
```
· Do it in triplicate and take the average.
```

**Sowing seeds on nursery bed**

```

```
block. It is suitable under unfavourable weather conditions such as rainy
```
· Water carefully with a watering can or hose fitted with a fine rose

Alternatively conduct a floating test to isolate good seeds from bad seeds.

**5.1.2 Nursery activities:**
· Soak seeds in clean water for two hours and dry before seeding to improve germination.

```
· Discard seeds that float on the surface of water. They are considered bad seed. Seeds that
```
```
· Raise seedlings in the nursery to ensure maximum seed germination and quality planting
materials.
· For farmer saved seeds, treat with recommended seed dressing or hot water at 50oC for
25mins in a water bath before sowing. (NB: seeds from certified sources are pre-treated).
· Raise seedlings in seed trays, boxes or on seed beds. Seedlings raised in trays normally
have a minimum 95% establishment rate in the field since they are transplanted with the
```
```
seasons and dry spells.
· It is highly recommended to raise all seedlings under protected structures such as net
houses or tunnels (inset image of a tunnel to illustrate what a nursery tunnel is)before they
reach the hardening stage.
```
**5.1.3 Raising seedlings**

```
· The germination percentage is good if test results show 85% and above.
```
```
· Pour seeds into a basin half-full of water
```
· Make rows of 15cm apart and 0.5cm deep on seed bed
· Drill seeds ensuring that no seed rests on another

other pests
· Mulch bed thinly with dry grass, straw or plastic film until seeds emerge
· Ensure seed bed is kept moist by watering lightly as and when necessary, preferably
in the morning and evening

Provide supplementary irrigation to maintain a good moisture level throughout the
growth period especially during flowering and fruit development.
· Water plants the day after transplanting using furrow, drips sprinkler or spot
irrigation.
· Irrigate when the soil is half wet or when plants start to show signs of wilt.

**8.0 WEED CONTROL/MANAGEMENT’**

· Control weeds by hoeing before plants are one month old in the field.

· At each weeding, earth-up around the stems to make plants strong to withstand
lodging.

· Mulching can be done to control weeds.
· Weed timely to avoid drastic yield reduction as a result of weed competition.

· Weed 2-3 weeks after transplanting.

· Repeat weeding every 3 weeks or weed when necessary.

Management
```
```
· Start monitoring from seedling stage, look at lower leaves, stems or growing points
for soft bodied insects found in clusters
· Keenly check underside of leaves, shoots and stems for immobile aphids
```
```
· Conserve natural enemies (e.g. ladybird beetles, hoverflies and Aphidius sp.) by
avoiding spraying broad spectrum insecticides
```
```
Monitoring
```
```
Prevention
```
```
· Spray soap solution (Potassium soaps e.gAlatasamina) (add 10-15 tablespoons of
liquid soap in 15L and spray on foliage
```
**Control**

```
· Avoid too much nitrogen which makes plant to be very succulent and attractive to
aphids
· Grow repellent plants like onions, garlic and marigold with the crop in alternating
rows to prevent aphids
```
```
· Spray with botanical extracts e.g. garlic, neem, red chilli pepper or soap (take 50g
mix in 2 L of water. Boil for 15 minutes, allow to cool and spray 3 times at 2 weeks'
interval)
```
```
· Remove and burn infected/infested plants to help reduce aphid populations
```
```
· Monitor (at least three times in a week) for aphids early in the morning or later in the
day especially during dry spells
```
```
Wrinkled and curled
pepper leaves
```

```
· Dot-like scars on fruit
```
```
Signs and Symptoms
```
```
· Eggs of fruit fly inside the skin of the fruit
· Larvae (maggots) feeding inside the fruit when cut open
· Check for rotten and fallen fruits
```
```
Fruit fly females lay eggs under the epidermis of the pepper fruit. An infested fruit usually has
a small dimple where the female fly has deposited an egg. After emerging from their eggs,
maggots generally move to the core to feed, but they may also feed on the walls of the fruit.
Maggots remain in peppers until fully grown (2 to 3 weeks). The maggot exits the pepper and
drops to the soil to pupate.. One maggot can destroy an entire fruit.
```
```
· Presence of adult flies on the field
```
```

· Avoid planting pepper near alternate hosts (mango, citrus, watermelons, tomatoes,
eggplants, avocadoes to reduce pest populations
```
**Prevention**

**Management**

```
· Prune regularly to improve aeration
```
```
· Conserve natural enemies like ants, rove beetles, birds and parasitic wasps by
practicing mixed/intercropping to enhance biodiversity, and avoid the use of broad
spectrum insecticdes
```
```
· Synchronize planting timing with other farmers in the area to avoid heavy infestation

```
· Spray Success Appat (food bait Spinosad (0.24g/l) The spray should contain ½ cup
(150ml) of the bait mixed with 5L water. Protection lasts 8 days
```
```
(iii) False Codling Moth ( Thaumatotibialeucotreta )
False Codling Moth (FCM) is a highly polyphagous and economically damaging pest.
FCM caterpillars can cause significant internal damage with little or no evidence of
infestation that can be seen from the outside. The only external evidence may be a
small oxidised mark on the skin of the fruit where the first instar caterpillars originally
penetrate, but this can be very difficult to detect. With time this can become a
distinctive but not always obvious, sunken brown spot on the skin
```
```
· Check for larvae on fruits or floral buds that have fallen to the ground and rosette
flowers and check for larvae
```
```
· Green brown with rows of dark bristled tubercles along the back of the larvae
```
**Signs and Symptoms**

```
· Presence of larvae at the base of developing fruits and flowers
```

```
· Avoid growing pepper in proximity to alternate host crops, e.g cotton, tomatoes,
okro, egg plants, pigeon pea and sweet potato
```
**Management**

```
· Minimize use of pesticides to conserve natural enemies like spiders, parasitic wasps,
praying mantis, ants and birds
· Gather and burn pepper sticks, stubbles and remaining fruits after harvest
```
**Prevention**

```
· Use trap count information to determine if the moth will be a serious pest in the
growing area, if numbers are high consider planting elsewhere or planting an
alternative crop
```
```
Monitoring
```
```
· Open fallen fruits to detect the presence of the larvae.
```
```
· Plough before transplanting during dry spell to expose the larvae/pupae to the natural
enemies and extremes of heat
```
```
· Begin monitoring for FCM moths at the seedling stage, scout weekly on plants for
eggs and adults of moths
```
```
· Monitor adults with traps baited with a pheromone attractant and inspect the traps
each week. If any moths are detected once the fruits are developing, take control
measures immediately
```

```
· Silvery leaf spots and slivery streaks on fruits
```
**Control**

**Signs and Symptoms**

```
· Destroy fruits that are infested and have fallen to the ground to reduce the build-up
cycle and avoid carrying over the pest to the next season. Put the fruits in plastic
bags and expose them to the sunlight or burn and bury to a depth of 60-90cm
```
```
· Look for tiny, slim, elongated, shiny, black insects on flowers
```
```
· Hand pick and crush caterpillars at initial infestation, check early in the morning or
late in the evening before they return into the fruit
```
**(iv) Thrips (** **_Thriptabaci_** **)**

```
· Thrips excreta are visible as small black dots on leaves
```
```
Thrips damage Thrips
```
```
· Remove alternative host (Centrossema, Musa spp.) from production fields
```
```
· Intercrop with maize or sorghum to reduce population of thrips
```
**Management
Prevention**

```
· Prior to planting, plough and harrow the field to destroy diapausing nymphs by
exposing them to sunlight
```

```
· Young leaves turn narrow, twisted or crumpled, fail to elongate and finally may wilt
and drygiving the plant a scorched appearance.
```
**(v)Mites**

**Monitoring**

```
· Thrips start infesting the plant before the flowers open. This causes the flowers to die
and become brown. Begin monitoring at flower bud initiation.
```
```
· The succulent part of the stem of young plants may become slightly swollen,
```
```
· Pick and open the flower buds to assess for larvae or adult thrips. Alternatively shake
the flowers unto a piece of white paper to determine the presence of thrips
```
```
· Spray with Deltamethrin product at 75-100mls/L
· Spray with Lambda Cyhalothrin product at 35-40mls/ 15L of water
```
**Signs and Symptoms**

**Control**

Mites are tiny and cannot be seen with the naked eyeand are difficult to detect with a hand
lens. An attack by the broad mites can be detected by the symptoms of damage. They live on
the underside of leaves, tender stems, fruits, flower peduncles and flowers.Symptoms
remain for a long period of time after control. They cause damage by sucking the cell content
from leaves.

```
· Spray with neem extracts (Nimacol, Nimbicidine) at a rate of 1 match box/L of water
or pawpaw leaf extract at a rate of 12 large matured leaves / 16L knapsack and spray at
80L/ha at 10-day interval during flowering
```
```
· Initial attack occurs on the stems of terminal shoots and the lower surface of young
leaves.
```
```
· Older leaves are generally cupped with corky brown areas between the main veins on
the lower side of the leaves.
```
```
· Feeding produces discolouration, necrosis of tissues and deformation.
```

```
· Adequate watering especially during periods of drought as mite damage will often be
worse on drought stressed plants first
```
```
(b) DISEASES:
```
```
· The damage shows up as a stippling of light dots on the leaves and sometimes the
leaves take on a bronze color.
```
```
· Attacked fruits become deformed with a cork-like surface or fail to develop. Severely
infested fruits falland yield is significantly reduced.
```
```
roughened or russeted. The foliage becomes rigid.
```
```
Management
Prevention
```
```
· Use high pressured water to wash off mites
```
```
· Check the undersides of leaves for mites, their eggs, and webbing. Mites can be
detected with the aid of a hand lens
```
**Monitoring**

```
· Avoid movement of mite infested seedlings from one field to the other
```
```
· Mites are tiny and difficult to detect, when monitoring, look for damage symptoms
such as stippled or yellow leaves
```
**Control**
· Spray with Sulphur 80 WP at a rate of 70mls/ 15L of water

```
· To observe mites more closely, shake a few of the leaf surface onto a white sheet of
paper.Once disturbed, they will move around rapidly

```
· Practice long crop rotation, 6 years with non-solanaceous plants (e.g. cereals and
grains –maize, millet) after 3 seasons
```
**Management
Prevention**

```
· Avoid planting on land with history of wilt disease
```
```
· Destroy plant debris immediately after harvest by burning
```
```
· Rotate nursery site each season and maintain good drainage
```
```
· Solarise soil using plastic sheets 6-8 weeks before planting
```
```
· Plant local varieties (e.g. Mesiwa) which are tolerant to wilt in high relative humidity
areas
```
```
· Practice long crop rotation, 6 years with non-solanaceous plants (e.g. cereals and grains
–maize, millet) after 3 seasons
Disinfect farm tools with 10% bleach solution after working in infested areas
· Rogue out and destroy plants that show early symptoms of the disease and destroy by
burning
· There is an interaction between nematodes (especially root-knot nematodes) and
Fusarium wilt so avoid planting in sites where nematodes damage has occurred
```
**Monitoring**

```
· Monitor field weekly for symptoms of wilt soon after transplanting
```

```
Galls on roots
```
```
(iii) Nematodes (Root-Knot Nematodes)
```
```
· Uproot affected plants to examine the root system and check for galls and swellings
```
```
· Stunted growth and zones of poor growth on the farm soon after transplanting
```
```
· There are No effective chemicals for the management of fusarium wilt
```
```
· Wilted and yellowing of plants
```
```
Control
· Rogue out and destroy plants that show early symptoms of the disease and destroy by
burning
```
```
Signs and Symptoms
```
```
· Do not transfer nematodes into a clean area when transplanting by reducing movement
of soil particles after use
· Expose ploughed land 2-3 weeks before transplanting, this may help to reduce
nematode numbers
· Farm tools (e.g. cutlasses) should be washed of soil particles after use
```
**Management
Prevention**


```
· Nematicides (chemicals) used in controlling nematodes are generally poisonous and
expensive. Nematicides should generally not be recommended to smallholder farmers
```
```
· Wilting, collapse and death of seedlings
```
```
· Rotate for 2 years with non-host crops: sorghum, millet. Broccoli or cauliflower
```
**Monitoring**

```
· Control weeds and volunteer crops or solanaceous plants
```
```
· Plant marigolds (e.g. Target patula) on fields for two months after harvest, plough into
soil before transplanting seedlings
```
Fields should be monitored regularly for symptoms of the disease

**Control**

```
· Rogue and burn affected plants with typical nematode symptoms at early stages of
plant growth
· Applications of poultry manure or cow dung at a rate of 5t/ha can boost crop vigour and
reduce nematode infestations on the crop
```
**(iv)** Damping off: It is a rot that occurs at soil level of the young crop (seedling stage) and
it is caused by fungi.

**Signs and Symptoms**

```
· Dark shriveled stems around the base and brown rotten roots
```
```
Damping off damage
```

**Prevention**

```
· To harvest, snap the fruit stalk from the stems by hand.
```
**Direct control**

**NB** : the plants must still be provided with nutrients especially more of K and less of N

```
· Clean or disinfect tools (tillers, cutlasses and hoes) using 10% bleach solution or fire to
heat
· Sow seeds thinly to ensure aeration. Plant in raised beds to maintain good drainage and
avoid over watering
```
```
· Remove infected plants as soon as symptoms appear and destroy away from nursery
```
```
· Depending on the condition of the pepper, harvesting can even continue beyond 6
months if there is no outbreak of diseases.
```
```
· Monitor nursery daily for symptoms such as wilting, collapse and death of seedlings
```
**Management**

```
· Solarize the soil of nursery beds before planting using clear plastic to sterilize. If the
problem persists, consider changing nursery sites
```
even after harvesting for more yield and crop quality.

```
· Peppers are ready for harvesting 6-8 weeks after transplanting. Harvest red ripe or green
depending on market demand.
```
```
· Second harvesting is done after 10 to 14 days. From then on, harvest once every week
even though the yield can drop after the 11 week. th
```
**Monitoring**

```
· Avoid excessive fertilization at nursery to reduce damping off
· Treat seed with Mancozeb 800g/kg, Folpet 500g/l at 3-4g/kg
```
**11.0 HARVESTING**


```
Pepper ready for harvesting
```
**11.1 Storage**
If the local market is the target however, the peppers are left to ripen and could take 8-9
weeks before harvesting. They are then parboiled and dried before selling.Harvested
peppers should be placed in the shade immediately after harvest and cooled as soon as
possible.

```
Solar drying of pepper
11.2 Marketing
Pepper can be produced for both local and export markets. Growing pepper for local and
export markets are prone to variations in market conditions. Producers should therefore
identify potential buyers who will give them an assurance of buying their pepper before
commencing production activities.
