### 1.0 INTRODUCTION

**Botanical name:** **_Zea mays_**

Maize is an annual grass in the Gramineae family, which includes such plants as wheat rye, ,
barley rice sorghum, , , millet and sugarcane.
Maize is the most important cereal in Ghana in terms of utilization. Its production has
increased over the years due to population growth, changing consumption trends and
industrial applications. It is a major source of carbohydrate for humans and animals (poultry
and livestock) and is cultivated in all agro-ecological zones. Maize is an annual crop where
every part of the maize plant has economic value; the grain, leaves, stalk, husk, tassel and
cob can all be used to produce a large variety of food and non-food products.

productivity. The grain production practices of Maize require knowledge and skill in order to
maximize the productivity and income of farmers. It is important to follow the right field
operations and post-harvest procedures.
```
```
Though Maize farmers are well aware of the advantages of Maize, limited access to quality
grains is one of the most important constraints to increased production and
```
**1.1 The Maize plant and developmental stage**

Maize is produced under diverse ecological conditions in different parts of the country. The
reasons for such large adoption and expansion of maize cultivation in Ghana include:

The crop is known to be botanically unique among cereal crops. It is monoecious plant with
separate male and female parts on different parts of the same plant

**Typical maize farm**

The male flowers are born terminally in a structure known as tassel and the female flowers are
born laterally in auxiliary shoot called ear and produces grains on lateral ears.

Approximately 50 to 60 days after pollination, most grains will reach physiological maturity.
This is the end of the grain filling process in which the dry weight of the grain no longer
increases. Grain filling takes place in three stages. These are:

With adequate moisture, optimum temperature and proper planting depth, seedlings can emerge
in 7 to 8 days and produce healthy and normal seedlings.

This stage lasts from emergency to tasseling. It is during the vegetative stage that the plant
establishes full potential of photosynthetic capacity to convert carbon dioxide and water into
carbohydrates and develop strong and healthy plants. Shortage of moisture and nutrient during
this stage will cause high yield reduction.

The reproductive stage (tasseling and silking) is the critical stage in the life of the maize
plant where pollination and seed set takes place. It is during this stage that enough moisture
and plant nutrient be available to the crop. Moisture stress during tasseling and silking can
reduce the final size and weight of the kernels.

**1.2. Maize plant growth and development**

Maize plant development stage can be divided into four major phases that are important in field
operation. These are planting to emergence, vegetative, reproductive and maturity stages.

**(i) Planting to Emergence**

**(ii) Vegetative stage**

Germination and seedling growth depends on soil moisture, temperature, and soil aeration.
Germination may start at temperatures as low as 8-10 C but occurs fastest between^0 28-32 C.^0

**(iii) Reproductive stage**

Tasseling marks the transition from the vegetative phase to the reproductive phase and is less
sensitive to environmental stress than silking.

**(i) Physiological maturity**

```
· Blister stage: Kernels are filled with clear fluid.
· Milk stage: Kernels are filled with a white, milky fluid
· Dough stage : Kernels are filled with a white paste. The top part of the kernels is filled
with solid starch.
```
```

```

```

```
Black layer development in the kernels is an indication for the end of grain filling. Kernels in
the middle region of the ear are the first to reach the black layer followed by those at the tip
kernels at the base of the ear mature last. Physiologically mature kernels contain 30 to 40%
moisture content.
```
```
Visible black layer
```
A mature maize kernel is made up of three main parts: The seed coat or pericarp, the starchy
endosperm and the embryo which will develop into a new plant.

```
· Flint maize , the kernels are hard, shiny and contain little soft starch. It is generally
believed that Flint maize has better storage capacity because of its hard endosperm.
```
```
· Dent maize is characterized by a depression or dent in the crown ofthe seed.
```
**1.3.2 Types of Grain**
Type of maize grain is classified into five groups based on theappearance and texture of its
kernel. The major ones are:

```
· Pop kernels are usually small in size and pop up when roasted.
```
**1.0 SITE SELECTION/CLIMATIC REQUIREMENTS**

Maize is generally adaptable to different environmental factors. Consider the following in
selecting a site for maize production: cropping history (inherent fertility, natural weed
population and common pest and disease incidences), topography (slope), soil type,
accessibility. Select well-drained deep, loamy soils containing sufficient plant nutrients
(including organic matter). Sandy, gravelly and shallow soils should be avoided, whenever
possible. Low lying areas are usually poorly drained and easily get waterlogged thus reducing
yield. Avoid planting maize in shady areas.

```

```
· It can be grown successfully on soils with a pH of 5.0 -7.0. Outside this pH range
results in nutrient deficiency as a result of unavailability of nutrients and mineral
toxicity. The optimum temperature for plant growth and development ranges from
30°C-34°C.
```
and fertilizers as well as to deliver the harvested grains to customers

fertility is highest and weeds are less of a problem on newly cleared land. Land which has been

Maize planted on newly cleared land will usually yield more than maize planted on land which
has been continuously cropped, especially in the forest and transition zones. This is because soil

cropped for several years needs fertilizer for good yields.

```
· Examine inherent fertility, natural weed population and common pest problems before
planting. There should not be any problem of water logging in the field.
```
### 3.0 VARIETAL SELECTION

Plant an improved variety for highest yield. Maize varieties are selected based on their
distinctive characteristics. Selection of a maize variety should also be based on weather
information, topography, soil type, ecology in your locality. The most suitable variety is the one
best meeting consumer preference and industrial use as well as adapting to the changing climatic
conditions (drought, pest and disease tolerance, earliness among others)
Based on the maturing duration, maize varieties in Ghana can be broadly categorized as

```
· Maize can be grown on a wide variety of soils, but performs best on well-drained,
well-aerated, deep warm loamy soils containing adequate plant nutrients (organic
matter and well supplied with available nutrients).
```
```
· Early maturing varieties (90-95 days)
· Medium duration varieties (105-110 days)
· Long duration varieties (> 110 days and longer)
```
Choosing sites with access to transport to facilitate the delivery of inputs such as seeds

```
· The choice of site is dependent on the vegetation and topography.

### 4.0 LAND PREPARATION

On land that has been fallowed for 2 years or more, practice traditional land clearing techniques
common in each agro-ecology. Farmers with access to tractors or bullocks can plough and
harrow their fields before planting. The following steps can be followed when preparing the
land for cultivation;

```
· Land for maize production can be prepared manually or mechanically depending on the
cropping history of the field. Clear the land by slashing or applying herbicides, and
plough and harrow across the slope of the land.
```
```
MAIZE PRODUCTIOn........................................
```

**NOTE:** If 90 seeds germinated, plant one or two seeds per hole depending on variety, but one or
two seeds is preferable.

**Germination Test**

```
· Count number of seeds germinated/seedlings that emerged at the end of the week.
```
```
· Count 100 seeds.
```
```
Germination test
```
```
Before planting, you have to do germination test. The steps are as follows:
```
```
· Prepare seed bed, water it and make shallow trenches about 5cm deep.
· Place the seeds in shallow trenches about 5cm deep, cover with 3cm layer of soil and
water well.
```
```
Always obtain seed from certified seed outlets where seed viability and variety purity can be
guaranteed. Seeds should be sorted to ensure that they arefree from diseases, pest infestation and
weeds. Soybean seeds lose viability rapidly if not properly processed and stored under optimum
condition. This results in poor germination. It is therefore important to conduct germination test
to help you decide on the seed quality and the seeding rate. Perform germination test as follows:
```

**5.1 When to plant**

```
· Maize can be planted on flat land or on ridges with one (1) or two (2) seeds per stand/hole
depending on the variety.
```
· Rippers can also be used across the slope to increase water percolation where there is hard
pan within the root zone. It is important to carry out soil test to know the soil suitability for
maize cultivation.
· The soil should be ready for planting two weeks in advance in order to allow weed seeds to
germinate

**5.0 PLANTING**

Planting is the most critical phase in the establishment of a new crop on a prepared field. Some
steps to consider before planting maize includes seed selection, germination test and seed
treatment. Altering planting dates can be used to escape diseases and pest incidence.

Planting time or periods differ according to agro-ecology, season and maturity group of the
variety. Sow after the rains have stabilized to avoid wilting. Planting time should be informed
by local weather information.

```
· Plant fields using certified seeds that are free from weed seeds, insect and diseases from
recommended Agro Input shops and seed companies.
· Planting can be done either mechanically or manually by hand at the onset of the rains or
when the soil is moist.
```
```
· Early planting in the season has been observed to be the most important single factor in
increasing yield and escaping pest attack.
· Depth of planting maize is important in protecting it against rodents, birds and drying.
Usually 5-7 cm deep is considered ideal.

Some of the nutrient management techniques including composting manure, crop residues,
controlled release and deep placement technologies for inorganic fertilizers.
```
### 6.0 NUTRIENT MANAGEMENT - FERTILIZER APPLICATION

```
Nutrient management is the process of managing the amount, source, timing, and methods of
nutrient application with the goal of optimizing farm productivity while minimizing nutrient
losses that could create environmental problems.Conducting periodic soil tests helps in
determining the nutrient (organic and inorganic) needs of maize and makes the appropriate
fertilizer recommendations.
```
```
For an acre of land, apply 2 bags of 50kg compound fertilizer and I bag of 50kg urea fertilizer.
```
```
NOTE: Practice crop rotation to maintain soil fertility and to reduce pest population.
```
```
The compound fertilizer commonly used is NPK 15-15-15. Apply 5bags of the 50kg
compound fertilizer 10-14days after planting and top dress at tasselling/booting with 2½
bags of Sulphate of Ammonia or 1½ bags of Urea per hectare. Apply 5-7tons of organic
manure per hectare.
```
### 7.0 WEED CONTROL/MANAGEMENT

Weeds compete with the maize plant for water, nutrient, space and light. The early stage of the
maize plant (3 weeks old) is very sensitive to weed competition. Weed control should therefore
be regular.

### 7.1 AFLATOXIN AND AFLASAFE

```
Aflatoxins are poisons produced by the fungus (mould) Aspergillus flavus and closely related
mould. Aspergillus flavus resides in soils and both dead and decaying organic matter. Aflatoxin
contaminates maize, groundnuts, sorghum and other crops including rice and dried chillies.
Aflatoxins pose health risks to humans and animals even at low concentrations. Aflatoxins-
contaminated crops typically are forced into low-value markets. Aflatoxin contamination
begins in the field, and increases during storage and transportation. Insect damage also increases
fungal growth and aflatoxin contamination.
```
```
controls aflatoxin during crop development, harvesting and storage. Aflasafe needs moisture.
Apply when the soil is wet (after rain or irrigation). Ensure that all agronomic practices
(weeding, applying of basal and top-dressing fertilizers etc.) have been done. This is in order to
avoid burying Aflasafe in the soil. Aflasafe must stay above ground. Broadcast evenly at rate of
4kg/acre or 10kg/ha. Wash hands thoroughly with soap and water after application.
```
```
Due to the incidence of aflatoxin which contaminates the pods and renders it unwholesome,
ensure that the crop is at the rifht stage for applying aflasafe. For maize apply Aflasafe 2-3 weeks
before tassels appear also known as ' flowering' by side-dressing along the rows on the soil
surface. Aflasafe is a 100% natural product and environmentally friendly that fights Aflatoxin.
Aflasafe effectively
```
```
MAIZE PRODUCTIOn....................................
```
There are two main methods of control;

```
· Mechanical methods : this involves the use of simple farm tools and implements such as
hoes and cutlasses in controlling weeds. Weeding should be done twice or three times and
it must start as early as possible because a young maize plant is very sensitive to weed
competition. Twice hand weeding, the first one at 25 – 35 days after planting and the
second at knee height and slashing weeds at flowering stage is recommended for proper
weed control.
```
```
· Chemical methods: this method of weed control involves the use of recommended and
appropriate selective weedicide.In chemical weed control the use of pre-emergence
herbicides at a rate of 3-5L/Ha supplemented by hand weeding gives good result in Maize
production.

**ii African Armyworm (** **_Spodoptera exempta_** **):** The African armyworm is a migratory moth.
The larvae (caterpillars) are important pests of pastures and cereal crops maily in Africa south of
the Sahara, Yemen and certain countries of the Pacific region.Only small numbers of the
caterpillars occur on pastures but periodically when the populations increase and mass
migration of moths occur, they can cover many thousands of square kilometres and traversing
international boundaries. They travel from field to field in great numbers, hence the name
"armyworm”. Outbreaksare observed during the onset of wet seasons when dry grasslands
produce new growth and cereal crops are planted.

### 8.0 HARVESTING

Harvesting maize on time is very important to maximize yields, minimizes grain losses and
quality deterioration. The use of weather information is important in timing harvesting. Timely
harvesting and post-harvest operations leads to preservation of grain quality, minimization of
grain losses and reduction of cost.
Maize should be harvested at physiological maturity. Harvesting should coincide with bright
sunshine and dry weather. Avoid late harvesting to reduce lodging, ear rot and insect problems.

Maize is harvested when it reaches physiologically maturity between 90days to 115days
depending on the variety. It can either be harvested in a fresh state or when dried.Harvesting can
be done by use of Combine harvester or by hand plucking. Combine harvester is used to harvest
when the moisture level ofmature cob drops below 24% to 18%.The maize is then dried to
moisture level of 12% for market and storage.

**NOTE:** during drying process, the sign of well dried maize; is when you take a grain and bite it,
if it is hard then it is dried but when not, then not well dried. During the drying process the kernels
arespread across raised pallets to ensure even drying. The moisture level should be at 10% if the
maize should be stored for long period in order to prevent mold and aflatoxins development that
leads to post harvest loses and food safety challenges.

**9.0 Post-Harvest Management and Grain processing techniques**

**(I) Drying**

This includes drying, sorting, shelling, cleaning, treating and bagging and storage of grain before
distribution.

Maize should attain the pre-determined moisture content of (13-14 %) after being harvested and
shelled. Field drying in the sun is commonly practiced. The grain should not be left in the field for
long because of risk of insects and diseases damage. For commercial purposes, dryers can be
used.

```
Cobs are sorted to discard off-types, moldy damaged or doubtful and diseased ears etc. Sorting
of the cobs can be done either at the farm or at the site of shelling.
```
```
(ii)Sorting
```
```
(iii)Shelling
The sorted ears are shelled when the moisture content of the seed reaches 13-14 %. Very low
moisture contents may result in more grain damage during shelling. It is important to use clean
and dry (preferably cemented or plastic sheet)threshing floor to avoid contamination by inert
matter and absorption of moisture from the floor.

**9.2 Management of storage diseases**

```
Sanitation measures, selection of uninfected cobs for storage, drying to a proper moisture
content, etc. can reduce mould infection in storage. Grain moisture can increase in storage due
to insect infestation; hence, controlling insect pests can control molds. To prevent spoilage by
storage fungi, the moisture content of starchy cereals grains should not exceed 13%.
