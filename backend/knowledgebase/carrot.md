**1.0		INTRODUCTION**

**Botanical name:** _Daucuscarota_

Carrot is believed to have originated in Afghanistan which remains the centre of diversity of _D.
carota_. They were known to the Greeks and the Romans and their early use was mainly medicinal, to
cure stomach problems, treat wounds, ulcers, liver and kidney ailments. Carrots were established as a
food crop in India, China and Japan in the 13th century.
Carrot ( _Daucus carota._ ) is an important vegetable among the succulent vegetables in world
production. In Ghana, it is one of the exotic vegetables with high value and great demand in urban
centres and a potential export crop. The edible roots are nutritious and contain water, protein, ash,
vitamins and minerals. Carotene, which is extracted from the roots, is used in colouring margarine and
to improve the colour of egg yolk when added to layer feed. The leaves and mature roots are used in
the preparation of animal feed .Carrot which belongs to the family Apiaceae is a biennial and usually
cultivated as an annual crop in the tropics. The root is the edible part and it is basically a swollen base of
the tap root that also includes the hypocotyls. It is conical and its length varies from 5 to 25 cm. The
colour of the roots varies from white, yellow, orange-yellow, light purple, deep red to deep violet.

```
Leaves
Leaves are produced in the first season. They have long
petioles.
```
```
Flower
The inflorescence is a terminal compound umbel, subtended
by pinnatifid bracts. The flowers of the umbel are white except
for the central ones which are either red or purple. Flowers are
produced in the second year.
```
```
Seeds
Like flowers, seeds are produced in the second year. Carrot
seeds contain essential oils. The carrot is an erect, biennial
plant, 30-100 cm in height and usually cultivated as an
annual in the tropics.
```
**Stem**
The stem consists of a small plate-like 'crown'.

2.0 SITE SELECTION/CLIMATIC REQUIREMENTS
Carrots thrive well and best in cool temperatures between 16ºC-21ºC for the production of good edible
long roots and good colour development. Carrots require deep, well-drained soil rich in well-
decomposed organic matter. Better root development and quality are obtained under cool
temperatures. It requires large amount of moisture therefore a reliable source of water supply must be
ensured. The crop is tolerant to soil pH of 5.5 to 6. 5.
```
**3.0		SEED/VARIETAL	SELECTION**
Use certified and high yielding seeds from reputable agro - input dealers. Some of the improved
varieties are Improved 38, Touch on 407, Amsterdam special, Tokita, Nantes and Kuroda. The seeding
rate is 4kg/Ha

**3.1 Germination Test**

Conduct a germination test before planting to be sure of the viability of your seed lot.
· Pick 100 seeds from the lot
· Sow in a seed box or bed.
· Count number of seeds germinated after 5-7days
· 85% - 95% means seeds are very good but if below 85% increase seed rate to make up for the
losses.
· Discard seeds with germination rate below 60%.

4.0 LAND PREPARATION
Clear the land and prepare the field beds incorporating well-decomposed organic manure before
planting. Beds must be raised. The soil must be prepared thoroughly and carefully to a fine tilth
removing obstructions such as stones or undecomposed organic matter that cause misshaped edible
roots.
```
```
5.0 PLANTING
· Mix seeds with clean sand and sow directly on the bed in drills spacing of 5 x30cm. This will
make it easier to sprinkle seed across the bed and you will know exactly where the seed has
been sown.
· Erect a shed over the bed when prevailing temperatures are high.
· After germination, soil must be stirred regularly by forking up to harvesting time.
· Thinning within the rows at 5cm apart is done 4 weeks after germination.
```
## 5.1 Irrigation:......................................................................................................................................

```
· Keep the soil well-watered, but not waterlogged.
· Irregular watering can produce split or diseased carrots. Avoid this by putting carrots on a
regular watering schedule or by watering carrots with a timed irritation system. Regular and
abundant well-distributed water supply is necessary especially in the dry season to avoid
development of woody and tough roots. Earth up the storage roots to prevent discoloration of
of the shoulders.
```
```
7.0 WEED CONTROL
Ensure regular stirring with a hand fork for good aeration and weed management. Weeds can also be
managed by hand.
```
```
6.0 FERTILIZER APPLICATION
Use soil test as a guide to fertilizer application. Apply 30-40tons/Ha of well-decomposed manure
or application of 10-20 t/Ha poultry manure for improved growth and yield is recommended.
Where there is no previous application of manure, apply 250kg/ha (50kg bag) of NPK 15-15-
(0.7g/plant) before planting has been recommended for improved growth and yield of the crop in
Ghana. On well-manured land, the application of 100kg/ha (50kg bag) of urea,4 weeks before
harvesting promotes good root development.

**8.0	 PESTS	AND	DISEASES	MANAGEMENT**

## 8.1 Pests:............................................................................................................................................

```
Leaf blight (Alternaria dauci)
Symptoms
· Leaves become brown to irregularly shaped lesions/spots on leaf blades and petioles. These
lesions usually appear on older leaves first and have a yellow margin
· Leaves gradually join together causing leaves to shrivel and die
· Seeds shrivel and will not germinate
· Disease will first appear in small patches in a field and will gradually spread
· Symptoms of bacterial blight are also similar but leaf spots are usually confined between leaf
veins
```

```
```
Management
· Plant a clean , certified seed or seed that has been treated with hot water at 50 oC for 20 minutes
· Do not plant carrots downwind , or next to an infected field since the disease can spread via wind
and water
· Apply farmyard manure as necessary to maintain soil nutrient levels. Nutrient deficiency can
increase the susceptibility of carrot to the disease (particularly lack of potassium)
· Irrigate early in the day to allow crop to dry. Irrigating at night will leave the crop damp and
promote disease development such as space damping off.
```

```
· Keep carrots free from of injury. Injured carrots are more susceptible to the disease
· If growing carrots in a greenhouse cover it with a UV- absorbin vinyl film to inhibit
development of A. dauci
· Clean machinery after use since it can spread the disease
· Rotate crops for at least three years with non-susceptible crops. Do not rotate with alternative
hosts garlic, celery, cabbage, cucumber, lettuce, parsley, radish, tomato, aubergine
· Rogue infected leaves to reduce disease spread. Burn the leaves (if allowed in your area) to
completely remove the source of the inoculum.
· After harvest, plough in crop debris to speed up decomposition. The pathogen only survives in
the soil on infected carrot residues

Carrots roots showing infestation by nematodes
```
```
Management
· Before planting, sample for nematodes at the end of a growing season when crop residues
remain (when nematode population are high)
· Adjust planting dates to cooler times in the season when nematodes are less active
· Plant clean certified seeds or seedlings from reliable sources
· Use clean irrigation (water which is unlikely to have run through nematode infested fields)
· Encourage healthy plant growth by maintaining optimal irrigation and fertilization levels.
Healthier plants are more resistant to nematode damage
· Clean farm tools and machinery with water after working in different areas of the field to
prevent spread of nematodes
· Do not introduce soil from an infested field into one which is not infested
```
**_(ii) Root knot nematodes (Meloidogyne incognita, M. hapla, M. javanica)
Symptoms_**
· Stunted growth above ground, yellowing of the leaves, wilting of the plant despite adequate
soil water content
· Forked, distorted or stunted taproot
· Fleshy galls on the roots that do not flick off easily on touching
· Formation of many adventitious roots
· Numerous deaths of plants in seed bed and seedlings do not survive transplanting
· Collapse of individual infected plants
· Symptoms can look similar to that of nutrient deficiency (stunting, leaf discoloration) and
injury to the ground root tip


```
Damping off damage
```
```
Damping off damage
```
```
· Rotate every season with groundnuts, cereals (maize, sorghum, millet),nappier grass, onions or
garlic as these crops are less susceptible to nematodes
· Plant marigolds ( Tagetes spp.) as cover crop at least two months before planting carrots since
these plants suppress nematodes. Grow them as solid planting for an entire season
· Leave the field fallow for 1- 2 years to lower nematode populations. During this time, keep the
soil moist but remove weeds. Nematode eggs will hatch but will not have anything to feed on so
they will die
After harvest, solarize soil by ploughing fields, moistening the soil and covering using a plastic
sheet for 4-6 weeks during the hottest part of the year
Alternatively, plough infested fields deeply to expose soil to sunshine for a month during the hot
seasons before planting the next crop.
```
## 8.2 Diseases:.......................................................................................................................................

**_(i) Damping off (Pythium spp.)_**
· Carrots infected with the _Pythium_ fungus fail to emerge, or they fall over and die soon after
emerging. Stems usually have a dark, shriveled portion at the soil line.
· _Pythium_ spp. may also cause root dieback of carrots by producing excessively branched or
stubbed roots.
· The fungus kills young tap roots less than 2 weeks after seed germination, reducing root length
and/or stimulating multiple root formation.


**Management**
· Avoid planting in very wet soils since _Pythium_ spreads in water and soil. Very wet soil
conditions favor the disease.
· Plant in light soils such as sandy loam. Maintain uniform soil moisture at seed depth until
seedlings emerge.
· Avoid planting during high temperatures and keep soil as cool as possible when the weather is
warm. Be sure seeds are not planted too deep.
· Protect soil surface from rain or sprinklers.
· Avoid over watering and provide good drainage.

**9.0 HARVESTING**
Carrots can be harvested when the roots are between 1.3cm-1.9cm in diameter **(63 – 70 days after
sowing)** depending on the variety. Soil must be well irrigated prior to harvesting. Harvesting is done by
lifting the crop with a fork and pulling the roots by hand. Care must be taken not to snap them since they
break easily.

## 9.1 Yield:.........................................................................................................................................

```
Yields up to 30mt/Ha can be obtained depending on the variety and based on best agricultural practices.
```
```
9.2 Post-harvest handling
After harvesting, the carrots are placed in a shade at the field in crates before washing. Carrots should be
washed carefully to cause as little damage as possible to the root surface.
```
## 9.3 Sorting and Grading:............................................................................... .................................

```
Carrots are sorted by hand to remove broken or split roots.
```
## 9.4 Packing :....................................................................................................................................

```
‘Baby’’carrots and those with very fine roots are usually packed in pre-pack containers and leaves are
normally removed. Perforated plastic bags, mesh pockets or cartons are other materials used for
packaging. Uniformity of root size is very important when packing carrots because it enhances the
presentation during marketing.
```
## 9.5 Storage:......................................................................................................................................

```
After harvesting, if necessary, carrots can be put in cold storage for 6months with good results. The best
results are obtained where the humidity is above 90 % and the temperature is approximately 0 °C.
```
## 9.6 Marketing:..................................................................................................................................

```
Carrots together with their leaves are still mostly sold in bunches of five to ten. When sent to distant
markets, carrots are sold without their leaves and in small bags. In self-service shops, carrots are sold
without leaves in transparent plastic bags. For processing, the leaves are cut off in the field and the
carrots are placed in bags or plastic containers and sent unwashed to the factory.
```
```
10.0 Uses
Carrots are consumed fresh as a salad crop or cooked. They are also processed either alone or mixed
with other vegetables. The juice is extracted and processed either alone or mixed with other vegetables.
The juiceisex tracted and used as a drink. Tender roots are pickled or made into jams and sweet me atsin
some countries. Carrot cake and carrot pudding can also be made. Thearomatic seeds are used as
astimulant and to relieve flatulence. The hole plants can also be used as fodder for cattle and horses
Carrots are said to be rich in ß-carotene, dietary fibre, antioxidants and minerals.
